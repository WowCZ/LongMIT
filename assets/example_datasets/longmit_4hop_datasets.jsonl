First used by the Chinese, chopsticks later spread to other East Asian countries including Japan, Korea as well as South and Southeast Asia such as Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and more recently Hawaii, and the West Coast of North America, and cities with Overseas Chinese communities all around the globe.\n\nChopsticks are smoothed and frequently tapered and are commonly made of bamboo, plastic, wood, or stainless steel. They are less commonly made from titanium, gold, silver, porcelain, jade, or ivory. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and used to pick up pieces of food.\n\nTerminology\n\nThe English word \"chopstick\" may have derived from Chinese Pidgin English, in which \"chop chop\" meant \"quickly\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest published use of the word is in the 1699 book Voyages and Descriptions by William Dampier: \"they are called by the English seamen Chopsticks\". Another possibility, is that the term is derived from chow (chow chow) which is also a pidgin word stemming from Southeast Asia meaning food, thus chopsticks would simply mean 'food sticks'.\n\nThe Standard Chinese term for chopsticks is ku\u00e0izi (). The first character (\u7b77) is a semantic-phonetic compound with a phonetic part meaning \"quick\" (\u5feb), and a semantic part meaning \"bamboo\" (\u7af9).\n\nIn ancient written Chinese, the character for chopsticks was zhu (\u7bb8; Middle Chinese reconstruction: d\u032ajwo-). Although it may have been widely used in ancient spoken Chinese, its use was eventually replaced by the pronunciation for the character ku\u00e0i (\u5feb), meaning \"quick\". The original character, though still used in writing, is rarely used in modern spoken Chinese. It, however, is preserved in Chinese dialects such as Hokkien and Teochew as the Min Chinese languages are directly descended from Old Chinese rather than Middle Chinese.\n\nFor written semantic differentiation between the \"fast\" (\u5feb) versus \"chopsticks\", a new character was created for \"chopsticks\" (\u7b77) by adding the \"bamboo\" (\u7af9) radical (\u2eae) to it.\n\nIn Cambodian, chopsticks are called changkuah (\u1785\u1784\u17d2\u1780\u17b9\u17c7).\n\nIn Japanese, chopsticks are called . They are also known as , a phrase commonly printed on the wrappers of disposable chopsticks. Te means hand and moto means the area under or around something. The preceding o is used for politeness.\n\nIn Okinawan, chopsticks are called nm\u0113shi \u3045\u3093\u3081\u30fc\u3057(\u5fa1\u7bb8,'Nmeesi). A special type of chopsticks made from the himehagi wood is used is altars of offerings is called s\u014dr\u014d nm\u0113shi \u305d\u30fc\u308d\u3045\u3093\u3081\u30fc\u3057 (sooroo 'Nmeesi \u7cbe\u970a\u5fa1\u7bb8).\n\nIn Korean, \uc800 (\u7bb8, jeo) is used in the compound jeotgarak (), which is composed of jeo \"chopsticks\" and garak \"stick\". Jeo cannot be used alone, but can be found in other compounds such as sujeo (), meaning \"spoon and chopsticks\".\n\nIn Vietnamese, chopsticks are called \"\u0111\u0169a\", which is written as \ud856\udf8a with \u7af9 tr\u00fac (bamboo) as the semantic, and \u675c \u0111\u1ed7 as the phonetic part. It is an archaic borrowing of the older Chinese term for chopsticks, \u7bb8.\n\nin Filipino, chopsticks are referred to as \"sipit ng intsik\" which is a compound of sipit, which means \"to grip\" or pincers and \"intsik\" which means Chinese\n\nHistory\n\nThe Han dynasty historian Sima Qian writes that chopsticks were known before the Shang dynasty (1766\u20131122 BCE) but there is no textual or archeological evidence to support this statement.\nThe earliest evidence is six chopsticks, made of bronze,  long and  wide, excavated from the Ruins of Yin near Anyang (Henan) and dated roughly to 1200 BCE; those were supposed to be used for cooking. The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi, a philosophical text written by Han Fei (c. 280\u2013233 BCE) in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nThe first chopsticks were used for cooking, stirring the fire, serving or seizing bits of food, and not as eating utensils. Chopsticks began to be used as eating utensils during the Han dynasty. Chopsticks were considered more lacquerware-friendly than other sharp eating utensils. It was not until the Ming dynasty that chopsticks came into normal use for both serving and eating. They then acquired the name kuaizi and the present shape.\n\nThe earliest European reference to chopsticks comes in the Portuguese Suma Oriental by Tom\u00e9 Pires, who wrote in 1515 in Malacca:\n\nUse\n\nTo use chopsticks, the lower chopstick is stationary, and rests at the base of the thumb, and between the ring finger and middle finger. The second chopstick is held like a pencil, using the tips of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, and it is moved while eating, to pull food into the grasp of the chopsticks. Chopsticks, when not in use, are placed either to the right or below one's plate in a Chinese table setting. Some Chinese people feel that using serving chopsticks is more sanitary.\n\nFor cooking\nSaibashi (\u83dc\u7bb8; \u3055\u3044\u3070\u3057) are Japanese kitchen chopsticks used in Japanese cuisine. They are used in the preparation of Japanese food, and are not designed for eating. These chopsticks allow handling of hot food with one hand, and are used like regular chopsticks. These chopsticks have a length of  or more, and may be looped together with a string at the top. They are made from bamboo, but for deep frying, metal chopsticks with bamboo handles are preferred, as the tips of regular bamboo chopsticks discolor and get greasy after repeated use in hot oil. The bamboo handles protect against heat.\n\nSimilarly, Vietnamese cooks use the oversized \u0111\u0169a c\u1ea3 or \"grand chopsticks\" in cooking, serving rice from the pot.\n\nStyles\nChopsticks come in a wide variety of styles, with differences in geometry and material. Depending on the country and the region some chopstick styles are more common than others.\n Length: Chopsticks are typically about  tapering to one end. Very long, large chopsticks, usually about , are used for cooking, especially for deep frying foods.\n Taper: Chopsticks are usually tapered in the end used for picking up food. Chinese chopsticks are more commonly blunt, while Japanese ones tend to be sharp and pointed in style. Korean chopsticks typically have sharp tapers, but with flatted grip.\n Material: A large variety of materials is available, including bamboo, wood, plastic, metal, bone, jade, porcelain, and ivory.\n Bamboo and wood chopsticks are relatively inexpensive, low in temperature conduction, and provide good grip for holding food. They can warp and deteriorate with continued use if they are of the unvarnished or unlacquered variety. Almost all cooking and disposable chopsticks are made of bamboo or wood. Disposable unlacquered chopsticks are used especially in restaurants. These often come as a piece of wood that is partially cut and must be split into two chopsticks by the user (serving as proof that they have not been previously used). In Japanese, these disposable implements are known as waribashi ()\n Plastic chopsticks are relatively inexpensive, low in temperature conduction, and resistant to wear. Melamine is one of the more commonly used plastics for chopsticks. Plastic chopsticks are not as effective as wood and bamboo for picking up food, because they tend to be slippery. Also, plastic chopsticks cannot be used for cooking, since high temperatures may damage the chopsticks and produce toxic compounds.\n Metal (commonly stainless steel) chopsticks are durable and easy to clean, but metal is slippery. Silver is still common among wealthy families, as are silver-tipped wooden or bone chopsticks. A common material for Korean chopsticks.\n Other materials such as ivory, jade, gold, and silver are typically chosen for luxury. Silver-tipped chopsticks were often used as a precaution by wealthy people, as it was believed that the silver would turn black upon contact with poison.\n Embellishments: Wooden or bamboo chopsticks can be painted or lacquered for decoration and waterproofing. Metal chopsticks are sometimes roughened or scribed to make them less slippery. Higher-priced metal chopstick pairs are sometimes connected by a short chain at the untapered end to prevent their separation.\n\nChina\nLonger than most other styles at about , thicker, with squared or rounded sides and ending in either wide, blunt, flat tips or tapered pointed tips. Blunt tips are more common with plastic or melamine varieties whereas pointed tips are more common in wood and bamboo varieties. Chinese sticks may be composed of almost any material but the most common in modern-day restaurants is melamine plastic for its durability and ease of sanitation. The most common type of material in regular households is bamboo.\n\nJapan \n\nIt is common for Japanese sticks to be of shorter length for women, and children's chopsticks in smaller sizes are common. Many Japanese chopsticks have circumferential grooves at the eating end, which helps prevent food from slipping. Japanese chopsticks are typically sharp and pointed. They are traditionally made of wood or bamboo, and are lacquered. Lacquered chopsticks were first used in the Yayoi Era, around 2000 years ago. Lacquered chopsticks are known in Japanese as nuribashi, which has numbers of varieties, depending on where they are made and what types of lacquers are used in glossing them. Japan is the only place where they are decorated with natural lacquer making them not just functional but highly attractive. The Japanese traditional lacquered chopsticks are produced from the city of Obama in Fukui Prefecture, and come in many colors coated in natural lacquer and decorated with mother-of-pearl from abalone and with eggshell to impart a waterproof shield to the chopsticks extending their life.\n\nEdo Kibashi chopsticks have been created by the hands of Tokyo craftspeople since the beginning of the Taish\u014d Period (1912-1926) roughly 100 years ago. These chopsticks are combined by high-grade wood (ebony, red sandalwood, ironwood, Japanese box-trees, maple), which craftspeople plane by hand. Edo Kibashi chopsticks, which are pentagonal hexagonal or octagonal, make them easy to hold. The tips of them are rounded to prevent to damage the dish or the bowl.\n\nIn Japan, chopsticks for cooking are known as ryoribashi, and saibashi when used to transfer cooked food to the dishes it will be served in.\n\nKorea \n\nUnique among East Asian cultures, chopsticks used by Koreans are often made of metal; depending on the historical era the metallic composition of Korean chopsticks varied (in the present day, the majority of Korean metal chopsticks are made of stainless steel (high-end sets, such as those intended as gifts, are often made of sterling silver), but in the past, such as during the Goryeo era, chopsticks were also made of bronze; during the Joseon era, chopsticks used by royalty were made of silver, as its oxidizing properties could often be used to detect whether or not food intended for royals had been tampered with). Chopsticks made of varying woods (typically bamboo) are also common in Korea.\n\nIn North and South Korea, chopsticks of medium-length with a small, flat rectangular shape are paired with a spoon (also unique to Korea; most East Asian cultures have either eliminated the spoon or have a much more limited use of the utensil) made of the same, usually metal, material. The set is called sujeo (a portmanteau of the Korean words for spoon and chopsticks). A spoon and chopstick rest, which is the piece to rest sujeo without touching the table, is used in traditional eating. Many Korean metal chopsticks are ornately decorated at the grip.\n\nIn the past, materials for sujeo varied with social class: Sujeo used in the court were made with gold, silver, cloisonn\u00e9 and so on, while commoners usually used brass or wooden sujeo. Nowadays, sujeo is usually made with stainless steel, although bangjja is also popular in more traditional setting.\n\nThailand\nNative cuisine uses a fork and spoon, adopted from the West. Ethnic Chinese immigrants introduced the use of chopsticks for foods that require them. Restaurants serving other Asian cuisines that utilize chopsticks use the style of chopstick, if any, appropriate for that cuisine.\n\nVietnam\nLong sticks that taper to a blunt point; traditionally lacquered wood or bamboo. A \u0111\u0169a c\u1ea3 (\ud856\udf8a\u5947) is a large pair of flat chopsticks that is used to serve rice from a pot.\n\nEtiquette\n\nChopsticks are used in many parts of the world. While principles of etiquette are similar, finer points can differ from region to region.\n\nCambodia\nIn Cambodia, a fork and spoon are the typical utensils used in Cambodian dining and etiquette. Spoons are used to scoop up food or water and the fork is there to help guide the food onto the spoon. Chopsticks are normally used in noodle dishes such as the Kuy Tiev and soup dishes. When eating soup the chopsticks will typically be paired with the spoon, where the chopsticks will pick up the food and the spoon will be used to drink the broth. Forks are never to touch the mouth, as it is thought as rude, thus they are not used to eat such dishes.\n\nChina\n\n When eating rice from a bowl, it is normal to hold the rice bowl up to one's mouth and use chopsticks to push or shovel the rice directly into the mouth.\n It is acceptable to transfer food to closely related people (e.g. grandparents, parents, spouse, children, or significant others) if they are having difficulty picking up the food. Also, it is a sign of respect to pass food to the elderly first before the dinner starts. Often, family members will transfer a choice piece of food from a dish to a relative's bowl as a sign of caring. A variation of this is to transfer the food whilst using one's own bowl as a support, underneath the food and chopsticks to keep food from falling or dripping, then transferring from there to a relative's bowl.\n It is poor etiquette to tap chopsticks on the edge of one's bowl; beggars make this sort of noise to attract attention.\n Holding chopsticks incorrectly will reflect badly on a child's parents, who have the responsibility of teaching their children.\n It is impolite to spear food with a chopstick. Anything too difficult to be handled with chopsticks is traditionally eaten with a spoon.\n It is considered poor etiquette to point rested chopsticks towards others seated at the table.\n Chopsticks should not be left vertically stuck into a bowl of rice because it resembles the ritual of incense-burning that symbolizes \"feeding\" the dead and death in general. This is also discouraged in South Korea and Japan.\n Traditionally, everyone would use their own chopsticks to take food from the dishes to their own bowl, or to pass food from the dishes to the elders' or guests' bowls. Today usually only in restaurants or gatherings with non-family guests present, serving chopsticks (\u516c\u7b77, \"community-use chopsticks\") are used. These are used to take food directly from serving dishes; they are returned to the dishes after one has served oneself. Due to better education regarding sanitary eating practices, many families are adopting this practice at private meals as well. Alternately, they can be left stationary on the table, especially in front of the host at the head of the table, so that the host can politely serve his honored guests on his left and right (and so they can serve him in return) without using their eating chopsticks. \n When seated for a meal, it is common custom to allow elders to take up their chopsticks before anyone else.\n Chopsticks should not be used upside-down; it is considered acceptable to use them inverted to stir or transfer the food from another plate (which the person does not intend to consume completely). This method is used only if there are no serving chopsticks.\n One should not \"dig\" or \"search\" through food for something in particular. This is sometimes known as \"digging one's grave\" or \"grave-digging\" and is extremely poor form.\n When taking food from a communal serving dish, one's chopsticks should not pass over someone else's chopsticks, hand, or arm; the diner should either take food to the side or wait.\n When taking food from a communal serving dish, it is done with the palm uppermost, as it is considered rude to show one's knuckles to dining companions.\n\nJapan\n\n The pointed ends of the chopsticks should be placed on a chopstick rest when the chopsticks are not being used. However, when a chopstick rest is not available as is often the case in restaurants using waribashi (disposable chopsticks), a person may make a chopstick rest by folding the paper case that contained the chopsticks.\n Reversing chopsticks to use the opposite clean end is commonly used to move food from a communal plate, and is acceptable if there are no communal chopsticks (for example, if the meal is hosted at someone's home).\n Chopsticks should not be crossed on a table, as this symbolizes death, or vertically stuck in the rice, which is done during a funeral.\n Chopsticks should be placed right-left direction; the tips should be on the left.\n In formal use, disposable chopsticks (waribashi) should be replaced into the wrapper at the end of a meal.\n\nKorea \n\nIn Korea, chopsticks are paired with a spoon (the set is called sujeo).\n Sujeo are placed on the right side and parallel to bap (rice) and guk (soup). Chopsticks are laid on the right side of the paired spoon. One must never put the chopsticks to the left of the spoon. Chopsticks are only laid to the left during the food preparation for the funeral or the memorial service for the deceased family members, known as jesa.\n Spoon is used for bap (rice) and soupy dishes, while most other banchan (side dishes) are eaten with chopsticks.\n It is considered uncultured and rude to pick up a plate or a bowl to bring it closer to one's mouth, and eat its content with chopsticks. If the food lifted \"drips\", a spoon is used under the lifted food to catch the dripping juices. Otherwise however, holding both a spoon and chopsticks in one hand simultaneously or in both hands is usually frowned upon.\n\nThailand\n\nHistorically, Thai people used bare hands to eat and occasionally used a spoon and fork for curries or soup, an impact from the west. Many Thai noodle dishes, such as pad thai, are eaten with chopsticks.\n Using chopsticks and spoon only for specific dishes, such as noodles.\n When a diner finishes their dish, they put their chopsticks on the bottom of the bowl.\n Chopsticks should not be left stuck into a bowl with food, as this symbolises \"feeding for dead people\".\n It is considered impolite to make a sound with chopsticks.\n It is poor etiquette to rest or hold chopsticks pointing towards others, as pointing is considered disrespectful.\n Chopsticks should not be used with a bowl of rice.\n\nVietnam\n\n Unlike with Chinese dishes, it is also permitted to use chopsticks to pick up rice from plates, such as fried rice.\n One should not pick up food from the table and place it directly in the mouth; food must be placed into one's own bowl first.\n Chopsticks should not be placed in the mouth while choosing food.\n Chopsticks should never be placed in a \"V\" shape when done eating; this is interpreted as a bad omen.\n The individual's chopsticks should not be dipped into a communal soup bowl (for example, when eating canh chua).\n Reversing the ends of the individual's chopsticks to the \"clean ends\" is preferred if communal serving utensils are not provided.\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nThe most widespread use of disposable chopsticks is in Japan, where around a total of 24 billion pairs are used each year, which is equivalent to almost 200 pairs per person yearly. In China, an estimated 45 billion pairs of disposable chopsticks are produced yearly. This adds up to  of timber or 25 million fully grown trees every year.\n\nIn April 2006, China imposed a 5% tax on disposable chopsticks to reduce waste of natural resources by overconsumption. This measure had the most effect in Japan as many of its disposable chopsticks are imported from China, which account for over 90% of the Japanese market.\n\nAmerican manufacturers have begun exporting American-made chopsticks to China, using sweet gum and poplar wood as these materials do not need to be artificially lightened with chemicals or bleach, and have been seen as appealing to Chinese and other East Asian consumers.\n\nThe American-born Taiwanese singer Wang Leehom has publicly advocated the use of reusable chopsticks made from sustainable materials. In Japan, reusable chopsticks are known as .\n\nHealth effects\nA 2003 study found that regular use of chopsticks by the elderly may slightly increase the risk of osteoarthritis in the hand, a condition in which cartilage is worn out, leading to pain and swelling in the hand joints. There have also been concerns regarding the use of certain disposable chopsticks made from dark wood bleached white that may pose a health risk, causing coughing or leading to asthma.\n\nA 2006 Hong Kong Department of Health survey found that the proportion of people using distinctly separate serving chopsticks, spoons, or other utensils for serving food from a common dish has increased from 46% to 65% since the SARS outbreak in 2003.\n\nSee also\n Chinese spoon\n List of eating utensils\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Chinese Chopstick Etiquette\n Japanese etiquette for chopsticks\n A gallery of chopstick images\n Bring Your Own Chopsticks Movement Gains Traction in Asia, article examining the link between chopsticks and deforestation\n How to use Chopsticks?\n Article about chopsticks from MrsLinsKitchen.com, March 2001\n\nCategory:Chinese food preparation utensils\nCategory:Chinese inventions\nCategory:Cooking utensils\nCategory:East Asian food preparation utensils\nCategory:East Asian traditions\nCategory:Eating utensils\nCategory:Japanese food preparation utensils\nCategory:Korean food preparation utensils\nCategory:Serving utensils\n"}, {"id": "BkksKfLxK0iAmX7RmB0L", "content": "Wok\n\nA wok (from Cantonese: \u944a) is a versatile round-bottomed cooking pot, originating in China. It is one of the most common cooking utensils in China and similar pans are also found in parts of East, South and Southeast Asia, as well as becoming a popular niche cookware in all the world.\n\nWoks are used in a range of different Chinese cooking techniques, including stir frying, steaming, pan frying, deep frying, poaching, boiling, braising, searing, stewing, making soup, smoking and roasting nuts.  Wok cooking is done with long-handled utensils called chahn (spatula) or hoak (ladle). The long handles of these utensils allow cooks to work with the food without burning their hands.\n\nEtymology and history \nThe wok is thought to have been introduced during the Han dynasty of China, where it was first used to dry grains. It was during the Ming dynasty of China that the wok became popularly used for stir frying.\n\nIn his book The Food of China, E.N. Anderson writes:\n\nAsian pans\nIn Indonesia the wok like pan is known as a penggorengan or wajan (also spelled wadjang, from Javanese language, from the root word waja meaning \"steel\"). In Malaysia it is called a kuali (small wok) or kawah (big wok). Similarly in the Philippines, the wok is known as kawali, while bigger pans used for festivals and gatherings are known as kawa. In India, a similar pan is called karahi.\n\nIn Japan the wok is called a . In South India, the Chinese wok became a part of South Indian cooking, where it is called the cheena chatti (literally, \"Chinese pot\" in Malayalam and Tamil).\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe wok's most distinguishing feature is its shape. Classic woks have a rounded bottom.  Hand-hammered woks are sometimes flipped inside out after being shaped, giving the wok a gentle flare to the edge that makes it easier to push food up onto the sides of the wok. Woks sold in Western countries are sometimes found with flat bottoms\u2014this makes them more similar to a deep frying pan. The flat bottom allows the wok to be used on an electric stove, where a rounded wok would not be able to fully contact the stove's heating element. A round bottom wok enables the traditional round spatula or ladle to pick all the food up at the bottom of the wok and toss it around easily; this is difficult with a flat bottom. With a gas hob, or traditional pit stove, the bottom of a round wok can get hotter than a flat wok and so is better for stir frying.\n\nMost woks range from  or more in diameter. Woks of  (suitable for a family of 3 or 4) are the most common, but home woks can be found as small as  and as large as . Smaller woks are typically used for quick cooking techniques at high heat such as stir frying (Chinese: ch\u01ceo, \u7092). Large woks over a meter wide are mainly used by restaurants or community kitchens for cooking rice or soup, or for boiling water.\n\nMaterials\nThe most common materials used in making woks today are carbon steel and cast iron. Although the latter was the most common type used in the past, cooks tend to be divided on whether carbon steel or cast iron woks are superior.\n\nCarbon steel\nCurrently, carbon steel is the most widely used material, being relatively inexpensive compared with other materials, relatively light in weight, providing quick heat conduction, and having reasonable durability.  Their light weight makes them easier to lift and quicker to heat.  Carbon steel woks, however, tend to be more difficult to season than those made of cast-iron ('seasoning', or carbonizing the cooking surface of a wok, is required to prevent foods from sticking and to remove metallic tastes and odors).  Carbon steel woks vary widely in price, style, and quality, which is based on ply and forming technique. The lowest quality steel woks tend to be stamped by machine from a single 'ply' or piece of stamped steel.  Less expensive woks have a higher tendency to deform and misshape. Cooking with lower quality woks is also more difficult and precarious since they often have a \"hot spot\". Higher quality, mass-produced woks are made of heavy gauge (14-gauge or thicker) steel, and are either machine-hammered or made of spun steel.  The best quality woks are almost always hand-made, being pounded into shape by hand (\"hand hammered\") from two or more sheets of carbon steel which are shaped into final form by a ring-forming or hand-forging process.\n\nCast iron\nTwo types of cast iron woks can be found in the market. Chinese-made cast iron woks are very thin (), weighing only a little more than a carbon steel wok of similar size, while cast iron woks typically produced in the West tend to be much thicker (), and very heavy. Because of the thickness of the cast iron, Western-style cast iron woks take much longer to bring up to cooking temperature, and their weight also makes stir-frying and bao techniques difficult.\n\nCast iron woks form a more stable carbonized layer of seasoning which makes it less prone to food sticking on the pan.  While cast iron woks are superior to carbon steel woks in heat retention and uniform heat distribution, they respond slowly to heat adjustments and are slow to cool once taken off the fire.  Because of this, food cooked in a cast iron wok must be promptly removed from the wok as soon as it is done to prevent overcooking.  Chinese-style cast iron woks, although relatively light, are fragile and are prone to shattering if dropped or mishandled.\n\nNon-stick\nSteel woks coated with non-stick coatings such as PFA and Teflon, a development originated in Western countries, are now popular in Asia as well.  These woks cannot be used with metal utensils, and foods cooked in non-stick woks tend to retain juices instead of browning in the pan.  As they necessarily lack the carbonizing or seasoning of the classic steel or iron wok, non-stick woks do not impart the distinctive taste or sensation of \"wok hei.\"  The newest nonstick coatings will withstand temperatures of up to , sufficient for stir-frying.  Woks are also now being introduced with clad or five-layer construction, which sandwich a thick layer of aluminum or copper between two sheets of stainless steel.  Clad woks can cost five to ten times the price of a traditional carbon steel or cast-iron wok, yet cook no better; for this reason they are not used in most professional restaurant kitchens.  Clad woks are also slower to heat than traditional woks and not nearly as efficient for stir-frying.\n\nAluminium\nWoks can also be made from aluminium. Although an excellent conductor of heat, it has somewhat inferior thermal capacity as cast iron or carbon steel, it loses heat to convection much faster than carbon steel, and it may be constructed much thinner than cast iron. Although anodized aluminium alloys can stand up to constant use, plain aluminium woks are too soft and damage easily. Aluminium is mostly used for wok lids.\n\nHandles\n\nThe handles for woks come in two styles: loops and stick. Loop handles mounted on opposite sides of the wok are typical in southern China.  The twin small loop handles are the most common handle type for woks of all types and materials, and are usually made of bare metal. Cooks needing to hold the wok to toss the food in cooking do so by holding a loop handle with a thick towel (though some woks have spool-shaped wooden or plastic covers over the metal of the handle). Cooking with the tossing action in loop-handled woks requires a large amount of hand, arm and wrist strength. Loop handles typically come in pairs on the wok and are riveted, welded or extended from the wok basin.\n\nStick handles are long, made of steel, and are usually welded or riveted to the wok basin, or are an actual direct extension of the metal of the basin.  Stick handles are popular in northern China, where food in the wok is frequently turned with a tossing motion of the arm and wrist when stir-frying food.  The classic stick handle is made of hollow hammered steel, but other materials may be used, including wood or plastic-covered hand grips.  Because of their popularity in northern China, stick-handled woks are often referred to as \"pao woks\" or \"Peking pans\". Stick handles are normally not found on cast iron woks since the wok is either too heavy for the handle or the metal is too thin to handle the tensile stress exerted by the handle.  Larger-diameter woks with stick-type handles frequently incorporate a \"helper\" handle consisting of a loop on the opposite side of the wok, which aids in handling.\n\nCooking\nThe wok can be used in a large number of cooking methods. Before the introduction of Western cookware, it was often used for all cooking techniques including:\nBoiling: For boiling water, soups, dumplings, or rice. In the latter case, guoba often forms.\nBraising: Braised dishes are commonly made using woks.  Braising is useful when reducing sauces.\nDeep frying: This is usually accomplished with larger woks to reduce splashing, but for deep frying of less food or small food items, small woks are also used.\nPan frying: Food that is fried using a small amount of oil in the bottom of a pan\nRoasting: Food may be cooked with dry heat in an enclosed pan with lid. Whole chestnuts are dry roasted by tossing them in a dry wok with several pounds of small stones.\nSearing: Food is browned on its outer surfaces through the application of high heat\nSmoking: Food can be hot smoked by putting the smoking material in the bottom of the wok while food is placed on a rack above.\nSteaming: Done using a dedicated wok for boiling water in combination with steaming baskets\nStewing: Woks are sometimes used for stewing though it is more common in Chinese cuisine to use either stoneware or porcelain for such purposes, especially when longer stewing times are required. Small woks are for hot pot, particularly in Hainan cuisine. These are served at the table over a sterno flame.\nStir frying: Frying food quickly in a small amount of oil over high heat while stirring continuously.\n\nWok hei\nWok hei () literally, the \"breath of the wok\", is a poetic phrase Grace Young first coined in her cookbook, The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen. In her book, The Breath of a Wok, Young further explores the ideas and concepts of wok hei. An essay called \"Wok Hay: The Breath of a Wok\" explains how the definition of wok hei varies from cook to cook and how difficult it is to translate the term. Some define it as the \"taste of the wok\", a \"harmony of taste\", etc.: \"I think of wok hay as the breath of a wok\u2014when a wok breathes energy into a stir-fry, giving foods a unique concentrated flavor and aroma.\"\n\nThe second character is transliterated as qi (chi) according to its Mandarin Chinese pronunciation, so wok hei is sometimes rendered as wok chi in Western cookbooks is the flavour, tastes, and \"essence\" imparted by a hot wok on food during stir frying. It is particularly important for Chinese dishes requiring high heat for fragrance such as char kuay teow and beef chow fun. Out of the Eight Culinary Traditions of China, wok hei is encountered the most in Cantonese cuisine, whereas it may not even be an accepted underlying principle in some of the other Chinese cuisines.\n\nTo impart wok hei the traditional way, the food is cooked in a seasoned wok over a high flame while being stirred and tossed quickly. Constant contact with the heat source is crucial as the addition of new ingredients and each toss of the wok inevitably cools the wok down; therefore, cooking over flame is preferred. Consequently, many chefs (especially those with less-than-ideal cookers) may cook in small batches to overcome this problem so that the wok is still as hot as it can be and to avoid \"stewing\" the food, instead. When cooking over gas stoves or open flame, it additionally allows for the splattering of fine oil particles to catch the flame into the wok; this is easily achieved when experienced chefs toss the wok and can be a demonstration of experience. For these reasons, cooking over an open flame is preferable to other types of stoves. Cooking with coated woks (e.g. nonstick) notably will not give the distinct taste of wok hei, which is partially imbued from previous cooking sessions. In practical terms, the flavour imparted by chemical compounds results from caramelization, Maillard reactions, and the partial combustion of oil that come from charring and searing of the food at very high heat in excess of . Aside from flavour, the texture of the cooked items and smell involved also describe wok hei.\n\nWok stoves\n\nTraditional \n\nWoks were designed to be used over the traditional Chinese pit-style hearth () with the wok recessed into the stove top, where the heat is fully directed at the bottom of the wok.  Round grate rings on the edge of the opening provide stability to the wok.  There are two styles of traditional wok stoves. The same design aspects of these Chinese stoves can be seen in traditional Japanese kamado stoves. The more primitive style was used outdoors or in well ventilated areas since hot gasses from the firebox exhaust around the wok.  The more advanced style, found in better-off households, has a chimney and may be used indoors. These stoves are similar in design to modern rocket stoves.\n\nPit stoves originally burned wood or coal but are now more typically heated by natural gas with the burner recessed below the stovetop.  In areas where natural gas is unavailable, LPG may be used instead.  With the adoption of gas and its less objectionable combustion products, the chimney has been replaced by the vent hood.\n\nThis type of stove allows foods to be stir-fried at a very high heat, sometimes hot enough to deform the wok itself.  Professional chefs in Chinese restaurants often use pit stoves since they have the heating power to give food an alluring wok hei.\n\nGas\nTraditionally shaped woks can be used on some Western-style (flat-topped) gas stoves by removing a burner cover and replacing it with a \"wok ring\", which provides stability and concentrates heat. Although not as ideal as \"pit stoves\", these allow woks to be used in a manner more suitable for their design and are good enough for most tasks required in home cooking.\n\nWok rings are sold in cylindrical and conical shapes. For greatest efficiency with the conical wok ring, position it with the wide side up. This allows the base of the wok to sit closer to the heat source.\n\nIn recent years, some consumer indoor stoves using natural gas or propane have begun offering higher-BTU burners.  A few manufacturers of such stoves, notably Kenmore Appliances and Viking Range Corp. now include a specially designed high-output bridge-type wok burner as part of their standard or optional equipment, though even high-heat models are limited to a maximum of around 27,000 BTU (7.9\u00a0kW).\n\nBecause of the high cost of kitchen modifications, coupled with increased heat and smoke generated in the kitchen, more home chefs are using their wok outdoors on high-heat propane burners with curved wok support grates.  Many inexpensive propane burners are easily capable of 60,000\u201375,000 BTU (17.5\u201322\u00a0kW) or more, easily surpassing most in-home gas stoves.\n\nElectric\nWoks, be they round or flat bottomed, do not generally work well for stir-frying or other quick cooking methods when used on an electric cooker. These stoves do not produce the large amounts of quick even heat required for stir-frying. It is possible, however, to find round-shaped electric stove elements that will fit the curve of a wok, which allows the wok to be heated at its bottom along with part of its sides. A flat-bottomed wok may also work better on an electric stove.\n\nCoupled with the lower heat retention of woks, meals stir-fried on electric stoves have a tendency to stew and boil when too much food is in the wok rather than \"fry\" as in traditional woks, thus not producing wok hei. A wok can, however, benefit from the slow steady heating of electric stoves when used for slower cooking methods such as stewing, braising, and steaming, and immersion cooking techniques such as frying and boiling. Many Chinese cooks use Western style cast-iron pans for stir-frying on electric stoves, since they hold enough heat for the required sustained high temperatures.\n\nA newer trend in woks is the electric wok, where no stove is needed. This type of wok is plugged into an electrical outlet and the heating element is in the wok. Like stove-mounted non-stick woks, these woks can also only be used at lower temperatures than traditional woks.\n\nInduction\nInduction cookers generate heat in induction-compatible cookware via direct magnetic stimulation of the pan material. While carbon steel and cast iron (the most common wok materials) are induction-compatible metals, induction cooking also requires close contact between the cooking vessel and the induction burner. This presents problems with tossing techniques, where the wok is lifted off the burner and agitated, will break contact and turn off the burner. Traditionally shaped woks, which are round-bottomed, also do not have enough contact with the cooking surface to generate notable heat. Bowl-shaped induction cookers overcome this problem and can be used suitably for wok cooking in locations where gas stoves are not suitable.\n\nFlat-bottomed woks make sufficient contact to generate heat. Some cookware makers are now offering round-bottomed woks with a small flat spot to provide induction contact, with a specially designed support ring, and some induction cooktops are now also available with a rounded burner that is able to make contact with the rounded bottom of a traditional wok. In both cases, the food will need to be stirred with a cooking utensil, instead of being tossed by lifting the wok itself.\n\nAdvantages\nThe main advantage of wok beyond its constructed material is its curved concave shape. The shape produces a small, hot area at the bottom which allows some of the food to be seared by intense heat while using relatively little fuel. The large sloped sides also make it easier for chefs to employ the tossing cooking technique on solid and thick liquid food with less spillage and a greater margin of safety. Curved sides also allow a person to cook without having to \"chase the food around the pan\" since bite-sized or finely chopped stir-fry ingredients usually tumble back to the center of the wok when agitated.\n\nThe curve also provides a larger usable cooking surface versus Western-style pots and pans, which typically have vertical edges. This allows large pieces of food seared at the bottom of the wok to be pushed up the gently sloped sides to continue cooking at a slower rate. While this occurs another ingredient for the same dish needing high heat is being cooked at the bottom. The pointed bottom also allows even small amounts of oil to pool. As such, large food items can be shallow fried, while finely chopped garlic, chili peppers, scallions, and ginger can be essentially deep-fried in both cases with very small amounts of cooking oil.\n\nSee also \n\n Cantonese cuisine\n Chinese cuisine\n ''Karahi\n List of cooking techniques\n List of cooking vessels\n Qozon\n Wok racing\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Cooking vessels\nCategory:Cantonese words and phrases\nCategory:Chinese food preparation utensils\nCategory:Chinese inventions\n"}, {"id": "BkksMfrxK1TjZJ7crGZN", "content": "Frying\n\nFrying is the cooking of food in oil or another fat. Similar to saut\u00e9ing, pan-fried foods are generally turned over once or twice during cooking, using tongs or a spatula, while saut\u00e9ed foods are cooked by \"tossing in the pan\".  A large variety of foods may be fried.\n\nHistory\n\nFrying is believed to have first appeared in the Ancient Egyptian kitchen, during the Old Kingdom, around 2500 BCE.\n\nDetails \nFats can reach much higher temperatures than water at normal atmospheric pressure. Through frying, one can sear or even carbonize the surface of foods while caramelizing sugars. The food is cooked much more quickly and has a characteristic crispness and texture. Depending on the food, the fat will penetrate it to varying degrees, contributing richness, lubricity, its own flavor, and calories.\n\nFrying techniques vary in the amount of fat required, the cooking time, the type of cooking vessel required, and the manipulation of the food. Saut\u00e9ing, stir frying, pan frying, shallow frying, and deep frying are all standard frying techniques.\n\nPan frying, saut\u00e9ing and stir-frying involve cooking foods in a thin layer of fat on a hot surface, such as a frying pan, griddle, wok, or sauteuse. Stir frying involves frying quickly at very high temperatures, requiring that the food be stirred continuously to prevent it from adhering to the cooking surface and burning.\n\nShallow frying is a type of pan frying using only enough fat to immerse approximately one-third to one-half of each piece of food; fat used in this technique is typically only used once. Deep-frying, on the other hand, involves totally immersing the food in hot oil, which is normally topped up and used several times before being disposed. Deep-frying is typically a much more involved process, and may require specialized oils for optimal results.\n\nDeep frying is now the basis of a very large and expanding worldwide industry. Fried products have consumer appeal in all age groups and in virtually all cultures, and the process is quick, can easily be made continuous for mass production, and the food emerges sterile and dry, with a relatively long shelf life. The end products can then be easily packaged for storage and distribution. Some include potato chips, french fries, nuts, doughnuts, and instant noodles.\n\nSee also \n\n Cooking oil\n Saut\u00e9ing\n Stir frying\n Pan frying\n Shallow frying\n Deep frying\n Air fryer\n List of fried dough foods\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Cooking techniques\nCategory:Food preparation techniques\nCategory:Culinary terminology\nCategory:Fried foods\n\nnl:Bakken\n"}, {"id": "BkksMC7xK6OrUjJy8vXW", "content": "Deep frying\n\nDeep frying (also referred to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, as opposed to the shallow oil used in conventional frying done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction.\n\nThe term \"deep frying\" and many modern deep-fried foods were not invented until the 19th century, but the practice has been around for millennia. Early records and cookbooks suggest that the practice began in certain European countries before other countries adopted the practice.\n\nDeep frying is popular worldwide, with deep-fried foods accounting for a large portion of global caloric consumption. Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding deep frying have developed, most notably in the Southern United States and the United Kingdom, where many events and records are held relating to deep frying food and non-edible items.\n\nHistory\n\nThe English expression deep-fried is attested from the early 20th century.\n\nFrying food in olive oil is attested in Classical Greece from about the 5th century BCE. The late Roman cookbook of Apicius (c. 400), appears to list the ancient Romans' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep frying spread to other parts of Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century.\n\nEvidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.  French fries, invented in the late 18th century, became popular in the early 19th century western Europe.  In 1860 Joseph Malin combined deep fried fish with chips (french fries) to open the first fish and chip shop in London.\n\nModern deep frying in the United States began in the 19th century with the growing popularity of cast iron, particularly around the American South which led to the development of many modern deep-fried dishes. Doughnuts were invented in the mid-19th century, with foods such as onion rings, deep-fried turkey, and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century. In recent years, the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep-fried foods, especially French fries.\n\nTechnique\nDeep frying food is defined as a process where food is completely submerged in hot oil at temperatures typically between  and . One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food, such as cornmeal, flour, or tempura; breadcrumbs may also be used. After the food is submerged in oil, the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins, creating the golden brown exterior of the food. Once the surface is dehydrated, it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption. The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins to denature, starches to undergo starch gelatinization, and dietary fiber to soften.\n\nWhile most foods need batter coatings for protection, it is not as necessary for cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content enables them to hold more moisture and resist shrinking. Meats may be cooked before deep frying to ensure that they are done inside while keeping juiciness.\n\nWhen performed properly, deep frying does not make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb \"no more than a couple of tablespoons per  cups of oil\" used. This oil absorption rate is around the same as occurs with shallow frying, such as in a pan.\n\nHowever, if the food is cooked in the oil for too long, much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food. The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food, but in most cases it lies between . An informal test for a temperature close to this range involves adding a tiny amount of flour into the oil and watching to see if it sizzles without immediately burning. A second test involves adding one piece of food to deep fry and watching it sink somewhat and rise back up. Sinking without resurfacing indicates that the oil is too cold; not sinking at all indicates that the oil is too hot.\n\nIt is recommended that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.\n\nTools\n\nDeep frying is done with a deep fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a cast-iron pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves may be used to remove or separate foods from the hot oil.\n\nJapanese deep frying tools include long metal chopsticks; the agemono-nabe deep frying pot, which is heavy for retaining heat and deep for holding oil; the ami-shakushi net ladle used for scooping out batter debris; and the abura-kiri oil drying rack pan.\n\nDishes, foods, and culture\n\nDeep-fried foods are common in many countries, and have also been described as \"a staple of almost all street cuisines on all continents\". There are hundreds of dishes that are associated with deep frying as most foods can be deep-fried. Examples of food that can be deep-fried include meat, poultry, fish and vegetables. Fish and chips, for instance, combines deep-fried fish and deep-fried potatoes. French fries, doughnuts, onion rings, and hushpuppies are common deep-fried foods. Other common deep-fried foods include Chinese You Bing deep-fried pancakes, Southeast Asian Jin deui, and Japanese tempura. Less common deep-fried foods include maple leaves, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, pizza, and Snickers bars.\n\nIn the United States, the Chicago Tribune notes that \"you can deep fry almost anything\". The American South has been noted as a modern center of innovation in the area of deep-fried food. According to the owner of a deep frying restaurant in the South, \"If something is edible, you can bet that someone south of the Mason-Dixon line has tried to cook it in oil\".\n\nAfrica\nIn Northern Africa, deep-fried dishes are a part of the cuisine. A common food in this region is the deep-fried fritter, also referred to as \"sponges\". In East Africa deep fried food is common, cooked in cast iron or earthenware pots.  Frying in batter is common. A Ugandan speciality is a kind of doughnut called Mandazi.  In areas of Southern Africa, street foods include deep-fried potato and cassava chips. Deep-fried foods in the country of South Africa include fish and chips, vetkoek and koeksisters, among others.\n\nAsia\n\nJapanese tempura is a popular deep-fried food that generally consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu.\n\nIn areas of Southeast Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.\n\nDeep-fried fish, tofu, and  are commonly eaten in Vietnamese cuisine. Deep frying is also used to make several kinds of , including  (fried rice ball),  (sesame ball),  (hollow doughnut),  (sweet potato pancake),  (banana fritter), H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y\u2013style  (shrimp fritter), and  (pillow cake).\n\nDeep-fried sticks of dough, known as youtiao in Chinese, are eaten in many East and Southeast Asian cuisines.\n\nIn Hong Kong, deep-fried intestine of pigs is a popular food.\n\nIn South Asia, popular deep fried snacks are samosa and pakora.\n\nEurope\n\nMany countries in Europe use pure or hydrogenated rapeseed oil for deep-frying. The deep-fried Mars bar originated in Scotland, with The Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven claiming to have invented it in the early 1990s. Fish and chips is a very popular deep-fried dish in England since it originated in London in the 19th century and became popular among the working class. Its popularity continues with 229 million portions of fish and chips being sold annually in England.\n\nThere is an annual trade fair devoted to deep-fried foods called the International Symposium on Deep-Fat Frying which features discussions on deep fat frying as well as exhibitions by companies involved with the process.\n\nBelgian tradition requires French fries to be deep-fried in filtered fat of cattle, locally called blanc de boeuf or ossewit.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States, soybean oil is often used for deep-frying. Beignets, originally a French dish, are a popular deep-fried pastry in the U.S. city of New Orleans. Deep-fried food has been a core part of the culture of the American South with many restaurants solely serving deep-fried foods. The owner of one such restaurant has said that the deep-fried food, \"in the South it's a way of life\". Fast food is one of the most common ways to consume deep-fried food in North America.\n\nNovelty deep-fried foods are popular today in American fairs, especially those in the American South. Hundreds of items are served at these fairs. Some of them include deep-fried beer, butter, and bubblegum. Additionally, deep frying can be used as a form of artwork by frying non-edible objects, such as electronics. Artists such as Henry Hargreaves have deep-fried replicas of electronic items such as iPads, Game Boys, and laptops.\n\nDeep-fried food contests are frequently held at fairs such as the Texas State Fair, where they hold an annual contest for the most creative deep-fried food. Notable past winners have included fried Coke and deep-fried butter, both invented by Abel Gonzales. Since 2013, an American reality competition show called deep-fried Masters, produced by Discovery Networks, holds deep frying competitions at several state fairs across the country.\n\nOceania\nMilk bars in Australia may purvey several types of deep-fried foods, along with other food types.\n\nSouth America\n\nThe bu\u00f1uelo, a fried dough ball popular in Central America and Greece, is a popular deep-fried snack and street food in South America. Picarone, a Peruvian dessert originated in the colonial period, are deep-fried cakes made with pumpkin and sweet potatoes, popular in Peru and Chile, especially during harvest festivals.\n\nOil deterioration and chemical changes \nDeep fat frying involves heating oil to temperatures in excess of 180\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of moisture and air. These conditions can induce a series of complex chemical reactions which may impact the quality of both the food and the oil it is cooked in. Examples of different chemical reactions include the production of free radicals, oxidation, hydrolysis, isomerization and polymerization. The exact reactions are dependent upon factors such as the oil type, frying conditions, and food being cooked. When frying, water can attack the ester linkage of triacylglycerols, resulting in di- and monoglycerols, glycerol, and free fatty acids (a type of hydrolysis reaction). The aforementioned hydrolysis reaction is enhanced by the produced fatty acids and other low molecular weight acid compounds.\n\nOverheating or over-using the frying oil leads to formation of rancid-tasting products of oxidation, polymerization, and other deleterious, unintended or even toxic compounds such as acrylamide (from starchy foods).  Recent research suggests fat deterioration may be worse when fat or oil is fried with food than when fat or oil is tested on its own in a laboratory. Deep-frying under vacuum helps to significantly reduce acrylamide formation, but this process is not widely used in the food industry due to the high investment cost involved.\n\nSome useful tests and indicators of excessive oil deterioration are the following:\n Sensory\u00a0\u2013 darkening, smoke, foaming, thickening, rancid taste and unpleasant smell when heating. This is the most unreliable way to decide when to change oil because those are very individual factors and can depend on different causes.\n Testing strips\u00a0\u2013 decide when to change oil depending on FFA (free fatty acids) only\n Oil-tester\u00a0\u2013 measurement tool to exactly define the point of change oil by TPM/TPC (Total polar material/compounds)\n Laboratory\u00a0\u2013 acidity, anisidine value, viscosity, total polar compounds, polymeric triglycerides.\n\nInstruments that indicate total polar compounds, currently the best single gauge of how deep-fried an object is, are available with sufficient accuracy for restaurant and industry use.\n\nHazards\n\nCooking oil is flammable, and fires may be caused by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, attempts to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This is the leading cause of house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.\n\nSpilled hot cooking oil can also cause severe third degree burns, In the worst-case scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil to stick to the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nDeep frying produces large amounts of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can contribute to the creation of fatbergs, overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes the time required to deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.\n\nHealth\nThe process of deep frying food is generally detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain large amounts of fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats has been linked to a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.\nAdditionally, fat degradation processes (lipid peroxidation) during deep frying results in the loss of nutritional value in deep-fried foods.\nCooking oil that has been used for too long may in addition cause blood pressure elevation and vascular hypertrophy.\n\nTrans fats are used in shortenings for deep-frying in restaurants, as they can be used for longer than most conventional oils before becoming rancid. In the early 21st century, non-hydrogenated vegetable oils that have lifespans exceeding that of the frying shortenings became available. As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations.\n\nSome studies have found that deep frying in olive and sunflower oils has been found to be less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.\n\nSee also\n\n Apple chip\n Banana chip\n Croquette\n Deep-fried pizza\n Deep-fried Twinkie\n Finger steaks\n French fries\n Fried chicken\n Fried pickles\n Karaage\n Lipid peroxidation\n List of deep fried foods\n List of fried dough foods\n Recovery time (culinary)\n Toasted ravioli\n Youtiao\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n  447 pages.\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n\n \nCategory:Cooking techniques\nCategory:Food preparation techniques\nCategory:Culinary terminology\n"}, {"id": "BkksMLnxK3YCRS0UZCfv", "content": "Fried chicken\n\nSouthern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.\n\nThe first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.\n\nHistory\nThe Roman cookbook of Apicius (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called Pullum Frontonianum.\n\nThe American English expression \"fried chicken\" is first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s.\nThe origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has been traced to precedents in Scottish and West African cuisine. \nScottish fried chicken was cooked in fat (though unseasoned) while West African fried chicken was seasoned (but battered and cooked in palm oil).  Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in the American South by African slaves.  Fried chicken provided some means of independent economy for enslaved and segregated African-American women, who became noted sellers of poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of this and the expensive nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular belief, a rare dish in the African-American community reserved (as in Africa) for special occasions.\n\nAfter the development of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and in a relatively short period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic and caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.\n\nWhen it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the slaves who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most slaves were unable to raise expensive meats, but generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African American communities of the South. After the abolition of slavery, it gradually passed into common use as a general Southern dish. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace, it gained further favor in the periods of American history when segregation closed off most restaurants to the black population. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for \"Sunday dinner\". Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish.\n\nSince the American Civil War, traditional slave foods like fried chicken, watermelon, and chitterlings have suffered a strong association with African-American stereotypes and blackface minstrelsy. This was commercialized for the first half of the 20th century by restaurants like Sambo's and Coon Chicken Inn, which selected exaggerated depictions of blacks as mascots, implying quality by their association with the stereotype. Although also being acknowledged positively as \"soul food\" today, the affinity that African-American culture has for fried chicken has been considered a delicate, often pejorative issue. While the perception of fried chicken as an ethnic dish has been fading for several decades, with the ubiquity of fried chicken dishes in the US, it persists as a racial stereotype.\n\nBefore the industrialization of chicken production, and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried.\n\nDescription\n\nFried chicken has been described as being \"crunchy\" and \"juicy\", as well as \"crispy\". In addition, the dish has also been called \"spicy\" and \"salty\". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with a chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste. This is especially common in fast food restaurants and chains such as KFC. The dish is traditionally served with mashed potato, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and biscuits.\n\nThe dish is renowned for being greasy, especially when coming from fast food outlets. It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low. Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken, the wings generally tend to contain the most fat, with almost  of fat for every . However, the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12% fat, or  per every . As well as this,  grams of fried chicken generally contains around 240 calories of energy.\n\nPreparation\n\nGenerally, chickens are not fried whole. Instead, the chicken is divided into its constituent pieces. The white meat sections are the breast and the wings from the front of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thighs and legs or \"drumsticks\" from the rear of the chicken. The breast is typically split into two pieces, and the back is usually discarded. Chicken fingers, which are boneless pieces of chicken breast cut into long strips, are also commonly used.\n\nTo prepare the chicken pieces for frying, they are typically coated in a flour-based batter that may contain eggs or milk, or they may be dredged in flour or breadcrumbs. Seasonings such as salt, black pepper, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, or onion powder can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or dipping in buttermilk, the acidity of which acts as a meat tenderizer. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust.\n\nTraditionally, lard is used to fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soybean oil, or other vegetable oils are also frequently used. The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.\n\nPan frying (or shallow frying) requires a frying pan of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.\n\nDeep frying requires a deep fryer or other device in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it at a very high temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.\n\nBroasting uses a pressure cooker to accelerate the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a pressure cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on the pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.\n\nThe derivative phrases \"country fried\" and \"chicken fried\" often refer to other foods prepared in the manner of fried chicken. Usually, this means a boneless, tenderized piece of meat that has been floured or battered and cooked in any of the methods described. Chicken fried steak is a common dish of that variety. Such dishes are often served with gravy.\n\nVariants\n Barberton chicken, also known as Serbian Fried Chicken, is a version created by Serbian immigrants in Barberton, Ohio, that has been popularized throughout that state.\n Chicken Maryland is a form of pan-fried chicken, often marinated in buttermilk, served with cream gravy and native to the state of Maryland. The recipe spread beyond the United States to the haute cuisine of Auguste Escoffier and, after heavy modification, found a place in the cuisines of Britain and Australia. The dish is made when a pan of chicken pieces and fat, as for pan frying, is placed in the oven to cook, for a majority of the overall cooking time, basically \"fried in the oven\".\n Popcorn chicken, also known as chicken bites or other similar terms, are small morsels of boneless chicken, battered and fried, resulting in small pieces that resemble popcorn.\n Chicken and waffles, is a combination platter of foods traditionally served at breakfast and dinner in one meal, common to soul food restaurants in the American South and beyond.\n Hot chicken, common in the Nashville, Tennessee area, is a pan-fried variant coated with lard and cayenne pepper paste.\n\nRacial stereotype\nIn the United States, fried chicken has stereotypically been associated with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.\n\nOn two occasions the golfer Tiger Woods has been the target of remarks regarding fried chicken. The first occurred in 1997 when golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said that Woods should avoid choosing fried chicken for the Masters champions' dinner the following year;  the second when golfer Sergio Garc\u00eda was asked in a press conference in 2013 whether he would invite Woods to dinner during the U.S. Open to settle their ongoing feud. Garc\u00eda, a Spaniard who was unaware of the existence of this stereotype in American society, committed a gaffe saying: \"We will have him round every night . . . We will serve fried chicken\", which Woods said was \"wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate\". Both Zoeller and Garc\u00eda subsequently apologized to Woods.\n\nIn 2009, a KFC in Beijing renamed their restaurant to \"Obama Fried Chicken\" in reference to recently inaugurated President Barack Obama. Despite controversy at the time, the owner refused to change the name back, and the restaurant continued to operate under this name .\n\nAt a dinner during Black History Month, an NBC chef, Leslie Calhoun, served fried chicken. The drummer of the Roots, Questlove, was angered by this and thought it both offensive and ignorant.\n\nIn 2012, Burger King released a commercial which featured Mary J. Blige singing about a crispy chicken wrap. The advertisement was controversial due to the racial stereotypes surrounding fried chicken, and prompted Burger King to remove it from YouTube and Blige to apologize for appearing in it.\n\nIn 2019, Will Hurd, an African-American Congressman, appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher. There, he said that while he was in the CIA he \"was the dude in the back alleys at four o'clock in the morning collecting intelligence on threats to the homeland.\" Bill Maher responded by saying \"That's where you'd collect it, huh? Wow. By the Popeyes Chicken?\" Maher was accused of being racist for making that remark.\n\nSee also\n\n John T.

In its home base, the food dish consists of fried chicken served with a cream gravy.\n\nHistory and preparation \nMany Maryland families have their own heirloom recipes for this dish, and it remains a regional specialty in Eastern Shore restaurants.\n\nThe primary factor that distinguishes Maryland fried chicken from other Southern fried chicken is that rather than cooking the chicken in several inches of oil or shortening, the chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally cast-iron) skillet and covered tightly after the initial browning so that the chicken steams as well as fries. Milk or cream is then added to the pan juices to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic.\n\nEscoffier had a recipe for \"Chicken \u00e0 la Maryland\" in his landmark cookbook Ma Cuisine, but there is no canonical version of the recipe. Often the chicken is marinated in a buttermilk marinade. Breading recipes vary in use of egg or buttermilk and the seasoning of the flour; the seasoning of the cream gravy also varies widely, although gravy is a signature aspect of the dish.\n\nAustralia \nIn Australia the term \"Chicken Maryland\" simply refers to a butcher's cut for a whole leg consisting of the thigh and drumstick.\n\nUK \nIn England, there is a small chain of stores known as Maryland Chicken, mostly found in Leicestershire. There is no connection between the store name and the traditional dish, however. Their menu consists of normal fried-chicken cuisine, similar to KFC.\n\nElsewhere \n\nOther reported versions include: a fried chicken leg with ham and hush puppies (a batter made with flour, egg, oil, and milk or water, to which corn is added, then deep-fried); batter-fried chicken with hush-puppies and batter-fried bananas and pineapple rings; and bread-crumbed and fried chicken wings & drumsticks with saut\u00e9ed bananas. \n\nApparently some Southeast-Asian variations exist, such as one with breaded chicken thighs, hush puppies, and gravy, served with deep-fried potato slices, baby carrots, fried tomato halves, and fried bananas. \n\nIn Argentina and in some neighboring South American countries, Suprema de Pollo Maryland is a pounded thin breast of chicken, breaded and fried, served with creamed corn, peas, bacon (panceta), French fries and a fried banana.\n\nIn China, Maryland Chicken is often served covered with mashed potatoes and a sweet corn gravy.\n\nThe final first-class lunch menu on RMS Titanic included a dish called \"Chicken \u00e0 la Maryland\".\n\nIn F.

In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, an appetizer, anju (food that is served and eaten with drinks), or as an after-meal snack.\n\nKorean fried chicken differs from typical American fried chicken because it is fried twice; the skin is therefore crunchier and less greasy. Furthermore, Korean-style chicken is not characterized by the crags and crusty nubs associated with American fried chicken; it was described by Julia Moskin of The New York Times as a \"thin, crackly and almost transparent crust\". The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chickens; these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. Pickled radishes and beer (or carbonated drink) are often served with Korean fried chicken.\n\nTerminology \nThe Korean word chikin () refers to fried chicken (and occasionally also to roasted chicken), while the name for the domesticated fowl is dak (). The word is shortened from peuraideu chikin (), which is a transliteration of the English phrase \"fried chicken\". According to the National Institute of Korean Language, the word chikin () refers to \"a dish made by coating chopped chicken with flour, and frying or baking it\". Fried chickens that are not chopped before frying are called tongdak (, \"whole chicken\"). Both chikin and tongdak are occasionally referred to as dak-twigim (, \"chicken fritter\").\n\nThe unshortened form peuraideu chikin, despite being the \"correct\" transliteration, is not as popular in Korea. The more commonly used form, huraideu-chikin (), may have been adopted in Korean owing to residual influence from the Japanese convention that persisted in Korea in the 1970s (the Japanese forced occupation only ended in 1945). The phrase huraideu-chikin is often shortened to huraideu () and refers to a fried chicken dish without the added seasonings post-frying. This is often used to differentiate it from yangnyeom-chikin (, \"seasoned chicken\"). The National Institute of Korean Language does not recognize huraideu-chikin as the conventional name, but insists on the transliteration (and transvocalization) peuraideu-chikin, which it also insists should be \"refined\" to dakgogi-twigim (, \"chicken meat fritter\").\n\nHistory \nThe concept of frying chicken in Korea has its beginning during the Korean War, when American troops were stationed in South Korea during the late-1940s, and the early-1950s. Traditionally, Koreans steamed chicken for consumption, and chicken dishes usually came in soups and broth. This all changed however, when Americans began placing stalls selling soul-food American fried chicken, focusing on the four areas of Seoul, Busan, Pyeongtaek and Songtan.\n\nThe modern trend of eating chicken began in Korea during the late 1960s, when Myeongdong Yeongyang Center in Seoul began selling whole chicken roasted over an electric oven.\n\nThe first Korean fried chicken franchise, Lims Chicken, was established in 1977 in the basement of Shinsegae Department Store, Chungmu-ro, Seoul  by Yu Seok-ho. Yu stated that his idea of selling smaller, individual pieces of fried chicken in Korea came along in 1975 when he went to go study abroad in the United States. He began frying chicken there, and received accolades for creating 'ginseng chicken'. He started his business in Korea with six pieces of fried chicken between \uffe6280 to \uffe6330, and sold around 900 pieces as his beginning career.\n\nThe well-known variety with spicy coatings, also known as yangnyeom-chikin, had its history begin in 1982 by Yang Hee-Kwon, who was running Pelicana Chicken at Daejeon. He noticed that customers in his restaurant were struggling to chew on the hard, crisp layers of the fried chicken, and led to inconveniences such as scraped palates. Yang decided to pull a twist on the traditional fried chicken to soften the hard shells of the chicken, and appease more Korean customers by marinating it sweet, and spicy. Yang states that despite the spicy flavor, the very first yangnyeom-chikin did not include gochujang as one of their marinating ingredients.\n\nIn recent years, owing to market saturation in Korea, many of Korea's major fried chicken chains, such as Mexicana Chicken, Genesis BBQ, Kyochon Chicken and Pelicana Chicken, have expanded to set up new presences in the United States, China, Canada, and Southeast Asia.\n\nVarieties\n\nBy seasoning \n Huraideu-chikin (, \"fried chicken\") \u2013 often simply referred to as huraideu (), this is the basic fried chicken.\n Yangnyeom-chikin (, \"seasoned chicken\") \u2013 also known in the West as yangnyeom-tongdak (, \"seasoned whole chicken\") despite not being tongdak, and also sometimes used as a synonym for \"Korean fried chicken\" by Western media, this is fried chicken coated in gochujang-based sweet and spicy sauce.\n Banban (, \"half-half\") \u2013 shortened from yangnyeom ban, huraideu ban (, \"half yangnyeom, half huraideu\") is often used to refer to chicken that is served half seasoned and half plain.\n Ganjang-chikin (, \"soy sauce chicken\") \u2013 fried chicken coated in ganjang-based sweet and savoury sauce, which is often also garlicky. \n Padak (, \"scallion chicken\") \u2013 fried chicken topped with or smothered with a large amount of thinly shredded scallions.\n\nBy style \n Tongdak (, \"whole chicken\") \u2013 also called yennal-tongdak (, \"old-time whole chicken\"), this is a 1970s-style whole chicken deep-fried in oil.\n Sunsal-chikin (, \"pure flesh chicken\") \u2013 boneless chicken.\n\nKorean Brands \n\n BHC\n Bonchon Chicken (\ubcf8\ucd0c\uce58\ud0a8)\nBuloman Sutbul Barbecue (\ubd88\ub85c\ub9cc \uc22f\ubd88 \ubc14\ubca0\ud050)\nChungman Chicken (\ucda9\ub9cc\uce58\ud0a8)\nDasarang (\ub2e4\uc0ac\ub791)\n Goobne Chicken (\uad7d\ub124\uce58\ud0a8)\n Kyochon (\uad50\ucd0c) \nMexicana (\uba55\uc2dc\uce74\ub098)\n Nene Chicken (\ub124\ub124\uce58\ud0a8)\nNorang Tongdak (\ub178\ub791\ud1b5\ub2ed)\n Puradak (\ud478\ub77c\ub2ed)\ntwo two chcken ( \ub458\ub458\uce58\ud0a8 )\n\nSee also \n\n Chimaek\n Pickled radish\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:Deep fried foods\nCategory:South Korean chicken dishes\nCategory:Fried chicken\n"}, {"id": "BkksKOzxaL3To-J3y1tS", "content": "Chicken katsu\n\nChicken katsu (), also known as panko chicken, or tori katsu () is a Japanese dish of fried chicken made with panko bread crumbs which is also popular in Australia, Hawaii, London, California, and other areas of the world.\n\nChicken katsu is generally served with tonkatsu sauce , a thick Japanese vegetarian pureed fruit-based brown sauce, or a well-seasoned ketchup, as a Hawaiian mixed plate lunch meal.

The two main types are fillet and loin. Tonkatsu is often served with shredded cabbage, or on a bed of rice (making it a donburi dish, called Katsudon).\n\nEtymology \nThe word tonkatsu is a combination of the Sino-Japanese word ton () meaning \"pig\" and katsu (), which is a shortened form of katsuretsu (), the transliteration of the English word cutlet, which again derived from French , meaning \"meat chop\".\n\nHistory \nTonkatsu originated in Japan in the 19th century.

Tonkatsu is sometimes served with egg on a big bowl of rice as katsudon.\n\nIn Nagoya and surrounding areas, miso katsu, tonkatsu eaten with a hatch\u014d miso-based sauce, is a speciality.\n\nVariations on tonkatsu may be made by sandwiching an ingredient such as cheese or shiso leaf between the meat, and then breading and frying.  For the calorie conscious, konnyaku is sometimes sandwiched in the meat.\n\nSeveral variations of tonkatsu use alternatives to pork:\n\n Chicken katsu () or Tori katsu (), which uses chicken instead, often appears in Hawaiian plate lunches.\n Menchi-katsu () or minchi katsu ( mince katsu), is a minced meat patty, breaded and deep fried.\n Hamu katsu ( ham katsu), a similar dish made from ham, is usually considered a budget alternative to tonkatsu.\n Gy\u016b katsu ( beef katsu), also known as b\u012bfu katsu, is popular in the Kansai region around Osaka and Kobe.\n\nA similar dish with ingredients other than pork, beef, or chicken is called furai (fry), not katsu (cutlet), such as aji-furai (fried horse mackerel) and ebi-furai (fried prawn).\n\nSee also \n Japanese cuisine\n List of pork dishes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nCategory:Breaded cutlets\nCategory:Deep fried foods\nCategory:Japanese fusion cuisine\nCategory:Pork dishes\nCategory:Sandwiches\nCategory:Fried pork\n"}, {"id": "BkksJ0_xK1UObcOyDlkK", "content": "Menchi-katsu\n\nis a Japanese breaded and deep-fried ground meat patty; a fried meat cake.

Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, staples include noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in sukiyaki and nikujaga.\n\nHistorically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has opened up to influence from Western cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food\u2014in particular Chinese food\u2014like ramen and gy\u014dza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat due to Buddhism, but with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as tonkatsu and yakiniku have become common. Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi, has become popular throughout the world.\n\nIn 2011, Japan overtook France to become the country with the most 3-starred Michelin restaurants; as of 2018, the capital Tokyo has maintained the title of the city with the most 3-starred restaurants in the world.\n\nTerminology \nThe word  is now the common word for traditional Japanese cooking.\n\nThe term  is actually synonymous with \"cooking\", but became a reference to mostly Japanese cooking, or restaurants, and was much used in the Meiji and Taish\u014d eras. It has come to connote a certain standard, perhaps even of the highest caliber, a restaurant  with the most highly trained chefs. But kappo is generally seen as an eating establish which is a notch more casual or informal compared to the ,\n\nThe  is tied with the Japanese tea ceremony. The kaiseki is considered a (simplified) form of , which was formal banquet dining where several trays of food was served.\n\nThere is also the homophone . The kaiseki referred to a gathering of composers of haiku or renga, and the simplified version of the honzen dishes served at the poem parties became kaiseki ry\u014dri. However, the meaning of kaiseki ry\u014dri degenerated to become just another term for a sumptuous carousing banquet, or .\n\nOverview of traditional Japanese cuisine\n\nJapanese cuisine is based on combining the staple food, which is steamed white rice or , with one or several okazu or main dishes and side dishes. This may be accompanied by a clear or miso soup and tsukemono (pickles).The phrase  refers to the makeup of a typical meal served, but has roots in classic kaiseki, honzen, and y\u016bsoku cuisine. The term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays.\n\nRice is served in its own small bowl (chawan), and each main course item is placed on its own small plate (sara) or bowl (hachi) for each individual portion. This is done even in Japanese homes. It contrasts with the Western-style dinners at home, where each individual takes helpings from the large serving dishes of food presented at the middle of the dining table. Japanese style traditionally abhors different flavored dishes touching each other on a single plate, so different dishes are given their own individual plates as mentioned, or are partitioned using leaves, etc. Placing main dishes on top of rice and \"soiling\" is also frowned upon by old-fashioned etiquette.\n\nThough this tradition originated from Classical Chinese dining formalities, especially after the adoption of Buddhism with its tea ceremony, it became most popular and common during and after the Kamakura period, such as the Kaiseki. Japanese cuisine keeps such tradition still, whereas in modern times such practice is in sharp contrast to present day Chinese cuisine, where placing food on rice is standard. However, an exception is the popular donburi.\n\nThe small rice bowl or chawan (lit. \"tea bowl\") doubles as a word for the large tea bowls in tea ceremonies. Thus in common speech, the drinking cup is referred to as yunomi-jawan or yunomi for the purpose of distinction. In the olden days, among the nobility, each course of a full-course Japanese meal would be brought on serving napkins called , which were originally platformed trays or small dining tables. In the modern age, faldstool trays or stackup-type legged trays may still be seen used in zashiki, i.e. tatami-mat rooms, for large banquets or at a ryokan type inn. Some restaurants might use the suffix  as a more sophisticated though dated synonym to the more familiar , since the latter basically is a term for a combo meal served at a taish\u016b-shokud\u014d, akin to a diner. Teishoku means a meal of fixed menu (for example, grilled fish with rice and soup), a dinner \u00e0 prix fixe served at  or , which is somewhat vague (shokud\u014d can mean a diner-type restaurant or a corporate lunch hall); but e.g. writer on Japanese popular culture Ishikawa Hiroyoshi defines it as fare served at , etc., a diner-like establishment.\n\nHistory\n\nAbout 2000 years ago, Japanese cuisine was developed with the influence of China. Rice is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Between 300 and 100 BC, rice was widely used in Japan due to Chinese influence. Wheat and soybeans were introduced shortly after rice. All three act as staple foods in Japanese cuisine today. During the Kofun period, Buddhism became the official religion of the country. Therefore, eating meat and fish were prohibited. In 675 AD, Emperor Tenmu prohibited the eating of horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens. In the 8th and 9th century, many emperors continued to prohibit killing many types of animals. The number of regulated meats increased significantly, leading to the banning of all mammals except whale, which were categorized as fish. During this period, chopsticks were introduced to Japan. Initially they were only used by nobility. The general population used their hands, as utensils were quite expensive.\n\nDue to the lack of meat products Japanese people minimized spice utilization. Spices were rare to find back in the day. Spices like pepper and garlic were only used in a minimalist amount. In the absence of meat, fish was served as the main protein, as Japan is an island nation. Fish has influenced many iconic Japanese dishes today. In the 9th century, grilled fish and sliced raw fish were widely popular.  Japanese people would eat fish in every one of their meals. In traditional Japanese cuisine, oil and fat are usually avoided within the cooking process, because Japanese people were trying to keep a healthy lifestyle.\n\nPreserving fish became a sensation; sushi was originated as means of preserving fish by fermenting it in boiled rice. Fish that are salted and then placed in rice are preserved by lactic acid fermentation, which helps prevent proliferation of the bacteria that bring about putrefaction. During the 15th century, advancement and development helped shorten the fermentation of sushi to about one to two weeks. Sushi thus became a popular snack food and main entr\u00e9e, combining fish with rice. During the Edo period (mid-15th century), sushi without fermentation was introduced. Sushi was still being consumed without fermentation till the end of 18th century, when the hand-rolled and nigri-type sushi was invented.\n\nIn 1854, Japan started to gain new trade deals with Western countries when a new Japanese ruling order took over (known as the Meiji Restoration). Emperor Meiji, the new ruler, staged a New Years feast designed to embrace the Western world and countries in 1872. The feast contained food that had a lot of European emphasis. For the first time in a thousand years, people were allowed to consume meat in public. After this New Years feast, the general population from Japan started to consume meat again.\n\nSeasonality\n\nEmphasis is placed on seasonality of food or , and dishes are designed to herald the arrival of the four seasons or calendar months.\n\nSeasonality means taking advantage of the  (e.g. bamboo shoots in spring, chestnuts in the autumn) as well as the  as they come into season. Thus  that arrives with the Kuroshio Current has traditionally been greatly prized.\n\nIf something becomes available rather earlier than what is usual for the item in question, the first crop or early catch is called hashiri.\n\nUse of tree leaves and branches as decor is also characteristic of Japanese cuisine. Maple leaves are often floated on water to exude coolness or ; sprigs of nandina are popularly used. The haran (Aspidistra) and sasa bamboo leaves were often cut into shapes and placed underneath or used as separators.\n\nTraditional ingredients\n\nA characteristic of traditional Japanese food is the sparing use of red meat, oils and fats, and dairy products. Use of ingredients such as soy sauce, miso, and umeboshi tends to result in dishes with high salt content, though there are low-sodium versions of these available.\n\nMeat consumption\n\nAs Japan is an island nation surrounded by an ocean, its people have always taken advantage of the abundant seafood supply. It is the opinion of some food scholars that the Japanese diet always relied mainly on \"grains with vegetables or seaweeds as main, with poultry secondary, and red meat in slight amounts\" even before the advent of Buddhism which placed an even stronger taboo. The eating of  was spoken of as taboo, unclean or something to be avoided by personal choice through the Edo period. The consumption of whale and terrapin meat were not forbidden under this definition. Despite this, the consumption of red meat did not completely disappear in Japan. Eating wild game\u2014as opposed to domesticated livestock\u2014was tolerated; in particular, trapped hare was counted using the measure word , a term normally reserved for birds.\n\nIn 1872 of the Meiji restoration, as part of the opening up of Japan to Western influence, Emperor Meiji lifted the ban on the consumption of red meat.  The removal of the ban encountered resistance and in one notable response, ten monks attempted to break into the Imperial Palace.  The monks asserted that due to foreign influence, large numbers of Japanese had begun eating meat and that this was \"destroying the soul of the Japanese people.\"  Several of the monks were killed during the break-in attempt, and the remainder were arrested.\n\nVegetable consumption has dwindled while processed foods have become more prominent in Japanese households due to the rising costs of general foodstuffs. Nonetheless, Kyoto vegetables, or Kyoyasai, are rising in popularity and different varieties of Kyoto vegetables are being revived.\n\nCooking oil\nGenerally speaking, traditional Japanese cuisine is prepared with little cooking oil. A major exception is the deep-frying of foods. This cooking method was introduced during the Edo period due to influence from Western (formerly called ) and Chinese cuisine, and became commonplace with the availability of cooking oil due to increased productivity. Dishes such as tempura, aburaage, and satsuma age are now part of established traditional Japanese cuisine. Words such as tempura or hiry\u014dzu (synonymous with ganmodoki) are said to be of Portuguese origin.\n\nAlso, certain honey or rustic sorts of traditional Japanese foods such as kinpira, hijiki, and kiriboshi daikon usually involve stir-frying in oil before stewing in soy sauce. Some standard os\u014dzai or obanzai dishes feature stir-fried Japanese greens with either age or , dried sardines.\n\nSeasonings\n\nTraditional Japanese food is typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, sake and mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. These are typically the only seasonings used when grilling or braising an item. A modest number of herbs and spices may be used during cooking as a hint or accent, or as a means of neutralizing fishy or gamy odors present. Examples of such spices include ginger and  red pepper. This contrasts conceptually with barbecue or stew, where a blend of seasonings is used before and during cooking.\n\nOnce a main dish has been cooked, spices such as minced ginger and various pungent herbs may be added as a garnish, called tsuma. With certain milder items, a dollop of wasabi and grated daikon (daikon-oroshi), or Japanese mustard are provided as condiments. A sprig of mitsuba or a piece of yuzu rind floated on soups are called ukimi. Minced shiso leaves and myoga often serve as yakumi, a type of condiment paired with tataki of katsuo or soba. Finally, a dish may be garnished with minced seaweed in the form of crumpled nori or flakes of aonori. Shichimi is also a very popular spice mixture often added to soups, noodles and rice cakes. Shichimi is a chilli based spice mix which contains seven spices: chilli, sansho, orange peel, black sesame, white sesame, hemp, ginger, and nori.\n\nDishes\n\nIn the aforementioned stock phrase , the word  has the basic meaning of \"vegetable\", but secondarily means any accompanying dish (whether it uses fish or meat), with the more familiar combined form , which is a term for any side dish, such as the vast selections sold at Japanese supermarkets or .\n\nIt figures in the Japanese word for appetizer, ; main dish, ; or  (formal synonym for okazu, but the latter is considered somewhat of a ladies' term or ny\u014db\u014d kotoba.\n\nSalads\n\nThe  is boiled green-leaf vegetables bunched and cut to size, steeped in dashi broth, eaten with dashes of soy sauce. Another item is , which could be made with wakame seaweed, or be something like a  made from thin toothpick slices of daikon and carrot. The so-called vinegar that is blended with the ingredient here is often  which is a blend of vinegar, mirin, and soy sauce. A  adds katsuo dashi to this. Note sparing use of oil, compared with Western salads.\n\nAn  is another group of items, describable as a sort of \"tossed salad\" or \"dressed\" (though aemono also includes thin strips of squid or fish sashimi (itozukuri) etc. similarly prepared). One types are  where usually vegetables such as green beans are tossed with white or black sesame seeds ground in a suribachi mortar bowl, flavored additionally with sugar and soy sauce.  adds tofu (bean curd) in the mix. An aemono is tossed with vinegar-white miso mix and uses wakegi scallion and  as standard.\n\nCooking techniques\nDifferent cooking techniques are applied to each of the three okazu; they may be raw (sashimi), grilled, simmered (sometimes called boiled), steamed, deep-fried, vinegared, or dressed.\n\nList of dishes\n\nBelow are listed some of the most common dishes:\n grilled and pan-fried dishes (yakimono \u713c\u304d\u7269),\n stewed/simmered/cooked/boiled dishes (nimono \u716e\u7269),\n stir-fried dishes (itamemono \u7092\u3081\u7269),\n steamed dishes (mushimono \u84b8\u3057\u7269),\n deep-fried dishes (agemono \u63da\u3052\u7269),\n sliced raw fish (sashimi \u523a\u8eab),\n soups (suimono \u5438\u3044\u7269 and shirumono \u6c41\u7269),\n pickled/salted vegetables (tsukemono \u6f2c\u3051\u7269),\n dishes dressed with various kinds of sauce (aemono \u548c\u3048\u7269),\n vinegared dishes (su-no-mono \u9162\u306e\u7269),\n delicacies, food of delicate flavor (chinmi \u73cd\u5473).\n\nClassification\n\nKaiseki\n\nKaiseki, closely associated with tea ceremony (chanoyu), is a high form of hospitality through cuisine. The style is minimalist, extolling the aesthetics of wabi-sabi. Like the tea ceremony, appreciation of the diningware and vessels is part of the experience. In the modern standard form, the first course consists of ichij\u016b-sansai (one soup, three dishes), followed by the serving of sake accompanied by dish(es) plated on a square wooden bordered tray of sorts called . Sometimes another element called  is served to complement the sake, for guests who are heavier drinkers.\n\nVegetarian\n\nStrictly vegetarian food is rare since even vegetable dishes are flavored with the ubiquitous dashi stock, usually made with katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and are therefore pescetarian more often than carnivorous. An exception is sh\u014djin-ry\u014dri (\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406), vegetarian dishes developed by Buddhist monks. However, the advertised sh\u014djin-ry\u014dri at public eating places includes some non-vegetarian elements. Vegetarianism,  was introduced from China by the \u014cbaku sect (a sub-sect of Zen Buddhism), and which some sources still regard as part of \"Japanese cuisine\". The sect in Japan was founded by the priest Ingen (d. 1673), and is headquartered in Uji, Kyoto. The Japanese name for the common green bean takes after this priest who allegedly introduced the New World crop via China. One aspect of the fucha-ry\u014dri practiced at the temple is the wealth of , one example being mock-eel, made from strained tofu, with nori seaweed used expertly to mimic the black skin. The secret ingredient used is grated gob\u014d (burdock) roots.\n\nDr. Masakazu Tada, Honorary Vice-President of the International Vegetarian Union for 25 years from 1960, stated that \"Japan was vegetarian for 1,000 years\". The taboo against eating meat was lifted in 1872 by the Meiji Emperor as part of an effort towards westernizing Japan.  British journalist J.\u00a0W. Robertson Scott reported in the 1920s that the society was still 90% vegetarian. 50\u201360% of the population ate fish only on festive occasions, probably more because of poverty than for any other reason.\n\nRice\n\nRice has been the staple food for the Japanese historically. Its fundamental importance is evident from the fact that the word for cooked rice, gohan and meshi, also stands for a \"meal\". While rice has a long history of cultivation in Japan, its use as a staple has not been universal. Notably, in northern areas (northern Honsh\u016b and Hokkaid\u014d), other grain such as wheat were more common into the 19th century.\n\nIn most of Japan, rice used to be consumed for almost every meal, and although a 2007 survey showed that 70% of Japanese still eat it once or twice a day, its popularity is now declining. In the 20th century there has been a shift in dietary habits, with an increasing number of people choosing wheat based products (such as bread and noodles) over rice.\n\nJapanese rice is short-grained and becomes sticky when cooked. Most rice is sold as hakumai (\u767d\u7c73, \"white rice\"), with the outer portion of the grains (\u7ce0, nuka) polished away. Unpolished brown rice (\u7384\u7c73, genmai) is considered less desirable, but its popularity has been increasing.\n\nNoodles\n\nJapanese noodles often substitute for a rice-based meal. Soba (thin, grayish-brown noodles containing buckwheat flour) and udon (thick wheat noodles) are the main traditional noodles, while ramen is a modern import and now very popular. There are also other, less common noodles.\n\nJapanese noodles, such as soba and udon, are eaten as a standalone, and usually not with a side dish, in terms of general custom. It may have toppings, but they are called . The fried battered shrimp tempura sitting in a bowl of tempura-soba would be referred to as \"the shrimp\" or \"the tempura\", and not so much be referred to as a topping (gu). The identical toppings, if served as a dish to be eaten with plain white rice could be called okazu, so these terms are context-sensitive.\n\nHot noodles are usually served in a bowl already steeped in their broth and are called kakesoba or kakeudon. Cold soba arrive unseasoned and heaped atop a zaru or seiro, and are picked up with a chopstick and dunked in their dip sauce. The broth is a soy-dashi-mirin type of mix; the dip is similar but more concentrated (heavier on soy sauce).\n\nIn the simple form, yakumi (condiments and spices) such as shichimi, nori, finely chopped scallions, wasabi, etc. are added to the noodles, besides the broth/dip sauce.\n\nUdon may also be eaten in kama-age style, piping hot straight out of the boiling pot, and eaten with plain soy sauce and sometimes with raw egg also.\n\nJapanese noodles are traditionally eaten by bringing the bowl close to the mouth, and sucking in the noodles with the aid of chopsticks. The resulting loud slurping noise is considered normal in Japan, although in the 2010s concerns began to be voiced about the slurping being offensive to others, especially tourists. The word nuuhara (\u30cc\u30fc\u30cf\u30e9, from \"nuudoru harasumento\", noodle harassment) was coined to describe this.\n\nSweets\n\nTraditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream, a very popular flavor. Almost all manufacturers produce a version of it. Kakig\u014dri is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk. It is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals. A dessert very popular among the children in Japan are dorayaki. They are sweet pancakes filled with a sweet red bean paste. They are mostly eaten at room temperature but are also considered very delicious hot.\n\nBeverages\n\nTea\n\nGreen tea may be served to most Japanese dishes. It is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms such as matcha, the tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\nBeer\n \nBeer production started in Japan in the 1860s. The most commonly consumed beers in Japan are pale-colored light lagers, with an alcohol strength of around 5.0% ABV. Lager beers are the most commonly produced beer style in Japan, but beer-like beverages, made with lower levels of malts called Happoshu (\u767a\u6ce1\u9152, literally, \"bubbly alcohol\") or non-malt Happousei (\u767a\u6ce1\u6027, literally \"effervescence\") have captured a large part of the market as tax is substantially lower on these products. Beer and its varieties have a market share of almost 2/3 of alcoholic beverages.\n\nSmall local microbreweries have also gained increasing popularity since the 1990s, supplying distinct tasting beers in a variety of styles that seek to match the emphasis on craftsmanship, quality, and ingredient provenance often associated with Japanese food.\n\nSake\nSake is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 15\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. At traditional formal meals, it is considered an equivalent to rice and is not simultaneously taken with other rice-based dishes, although this notion is typically no longer applied to modern, refined, premium (\"ginjo\") sake, which bear little resemblance to the sakes of even 100 years ago. Side dishes for sake are particularly called sakana or otsumami.\n\nSake is brewed in a highly labor-intensive process more similar to beer production than winemaking, hence, the common description of sake as rice \"wine\" is misleading.\nSake is made with, by legal definition, strictly just four ingredients: special rice, water, koji, and special yeast.\n\nAs of 2014, Japan has some 1500 registered breweries, which produce thousands of different sakes. Sake characteristics and flavor profiles vary with regionality, ingredients, and the styles (maintained by brewmaster guilds) that brewery leaders want to produce.\n\nSake flavor profiles lend extremely well to pairing with a wide variety of cuisines, including non-Japanese cuisines.\n\nSh\u014dch\u016b\nSh\u014dch\u016b is a distilled spirit that is typically made from barley, sweet potato, buckwheat, or rice. Sh\u014dch\u016b is produced everywhere in Japan, but its production started in Kyushu.\n\nWhisky\n\nJapanese whisky began commercial production in the early 20th century, and is now extremely popular, primarily consumed in . It is produced in the Scottish style, with malt whisky produced since the 1980s, and has since won top international awards, since the 2000s.\n\nWine\nA domestic wine production exists since the 1860s yet most wine is imported. The total market share of wine on alcoholic beverages is about 3%.\n\nRegional cuisine\n\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties known as ky\u014ddo-ry\u014dri (\u90f7\u571f\u6599\u7406), many of them originating from dishes prepared using traditional recipes with local ingredients. Foods from the Kant\u014d region taste very strong. For example, the dashi-based broth for serving udon noodles is heavy on dark soy sauce, similar to soba broth. On the other hand, Kansai region foods are lightly seasoned, with clear udon noodles. made with light soy sauce.\n\nTraditional table settings\nThe traditional Japanese table setting has varied considerably over the centuries, depending primarily on the type of table common during a given era. Before the 19th century, small individual box tables (hakozen, \u7bb1\u81b3) or flat floor trays were set before each diner. Larger low tables (chabudai, \u3061\u3083\u3076\u53f0) that accommodated entire families were gaining popularity by the beginning of the 20th century, but these gave way to Western-style dining tables and chairs by the end of the 20th century.\n\nTraditional Japanese table setting is to place a bowl of rice on your left and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table. Behind these, each okazu is served on its own individual plate. Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, and one in the center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.\n\nDining etiquette\n\nMany restaurants and homes in Japan are equipped with Western-style chairs and tables. However, traditional Japanese low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, are also very common. Tatami mats, which are made of straw, can be easily damaged and are hard to clean, thus shoes or any type of footwear are always taken off when stepping on tatami floors.\n\nWhen dining in a traditional tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as seiza. To sit in a seiza position, one kneels on the floor with legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels.\n\nWhen dining out in a restaurant, the customers are guided to their seats by the host. The honored or eldest guest will usually be seated at the center of the table farthest from the entrance. In the home, the most important guest is also seated farthest away from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma, or alcove, in the room, the guest is seated in front of it. The host sits next to or closest to the entrance.\n\nIn Japan, it is customary to say itadakimasu (\"I [humbly] receive\") before starting to eat a meal. When saying itadakimasu, both hands are put together in front of the chest or on the lap. Itadakimasu is preceded by complimenting the appearance of food. The Japanese attach as much importance to the aesthetic arrangement of the food as its actual taste. Before touching the food, it is polite to compliment the host on his artistry. It is also a polite custom to wait for the eldest guest at the table to start eating before the other diners start. Another customary and important etiquette is to say go-chis\u014d-sama deshita (\"It was a feast\") to the host after the meal and the restaurant staff when leaving.\n\nDishes for special occasions\n\nIn Japanese tradition some dishes are strongly tied to a festival or event. These dishes include:\n Botamochi, a sticky rice dumpling with sweet azuki paste served in spring, while a similar sweet Ohagi is served in autumn.\n Chimaki (steamed sweet rice cake): Tango no sekku and Gion Festival.\n Hamo (a type of fish, often eel) and s\u014dmen: Gion Festival.\n Osechi: New Year.\n Sekihan, is red rice, which is served for any celebratory occasion. It is usually sticky rice cooked with azuki, or red bean, which gives the rice its distinctive red color.\n Soba: New Year's Eve. This is called toshi koshi soba (:ja:\u5e74\u8d8a\u3057\u305d\u3070) (literally \"year crossing soba\").\n Chirashizushi, Ushiojiru (clear soup of clams) and amazake: Hinamatsuri.\n\nIn some regions every 1st and 15th day of the month people eat a mixture of rice and azuki (azuki meshi (\u5c0f\u8c46\u98ef), see Sekihan).\n\nImported and adapted foods\nJapan has a long history of importing food from other countries, some of which are now part of Japan's most popular cuisine. Ramen is considered an important part to their culinary history, to the extent where in survey of 2,000 Tokyo residents, instant ramen came up many times as a product they thought was an outstanding Japanese invention. Believed to have originated in China, Ramen became popular in Japan after the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937\u20131945), when many Chinese students were displaced to Japan.\n\nCurry is another popular imported dish and is ranked near the top of nearly all Japanese surveys for favorite foods. The average Japanese person eats curry at least once a week. The origins of curry, as well many other foreign imports such as pan or bread are linked to the emergence of Y\u014dshoku, or western cuisine. Y\u014dshoku can be traced as far back as the late Muromachi period (1336\u20131573) during a culinary revolution called namban ryori (\u5357\u86ee\u6599\u7406), which means \u201cSouthern barbarian cooking\u201d, as it is rooted in European cuisine. This cuisine style was first seen in Nagasaki, which served as the point of contact between Europe and Japan at that point in time. Food items such as potatoes, corn, dairy products, as well as the hard candy kompeito (\u91d1\u5e73\u7cd6), spread during this time. This cuisine became popular in the Meiji period, which is considered by many historians to be when Japan first opened itself to the outside world. Today, many of these imported items still hold a heavy presence in Japan.\n Foods imported from Portugal in the 16th century\n Other adapted cuisines in Japan\n\nY\u014dshoku \u2013 Foreign (Western) food, dishes\n\nJapan today abounds with home-grown, loosely Western-style food. Many of these were invented in the wake of the 1868 Meiji Restoration and the end of national seclusion, when the sudden influx of foreign (in particular, Western) culture led to many restaurants serving Western food, known as y\u014dshoku (\u6d0b\u98df), a shortened form of seiy\u014dshoku (\u897f\u6d0b\u98df, \"Western cuisine\"), opening up in cities. Restaurants that serve these foods are called y\u014dshokuya (\u6d0b\u98df\u5c4b, \"Western cuisine restaurants\").\n\nMany y\u014dshoku items from that time have been adapted to a degree that they are now considered Japanese and are an integral part of any Japanese family menu. Many are served alongside rice and miso soup, and eaten with chopsticks. Yet, due to their origins these are still categorized as y\u014dshoku as opposed to the more traditional washoku (\u548c\u98df, \"Japanese cuisine\").\n\nOkonomiyaki\n\nOkonomiyaki is a savoury pancake containing a variety of ingredients.\n\nTonkatsu\n\nTonkatsu is a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet.\n\nCurry\n\nCurry was introduced to Japan by the British in the Meiji period. Japanese versions of curry can be found in foods such as curry udon, curry bread, and katsukar\u0113, tonkatsu served with curry. They very commonly come with rice beside the curry on the dish. This can be eaten during dinner most of the time.\n\nRamen\n\nChinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat stock broth known as ramen have become extremely popular over the last century.\n\nWaf\u016b burgers (Japanese-style burgers)\nHamburger chains active in Japan include McDonald's, Burger King, First Kitchen, Lotteria and MOS Burger. Many chains developed uniquely Japanese versions of American fast food such as the teriyaki burger, kinpira (saut\u00e9) rice burger, fried shrimp burgers, and green tea milkshakes.\n\nItalian\nHigh-class Japanese chefs have preserved many Italian seafood dishes that are forgotten in other countries. These include pasta with prawns, lobster (a specialty known in Italy as pasta all'aragosta), crab (an Italian specialty; in Japan it is served with a different species of crab), and pasta with sea urchin sauce (sea urchin pasta being a specialty of the Puglia region).\n\nOutside Japan\n\nMany countries have imported portions of Japanese cuisine. Some may adhere to the traditional preparations of the cuisines, but in some cultures the dishes have been adapted to fit the palate of the local populace. In 1970s sushi travelled from Japan to Canada and the United States, it was modified to suit the American palate, and re-entered the Japanese market as \"American Sushi\". An example of this phenomenon is the California roll, which was created in North America in the 1970s, rose in popularity across the United States through the 1980s, and thus sparked Japanese food's\u00a0\u2013 more precisely, sushi's\u00a0\u2013 global popularity.\n\nIn 2014, Japanese Restaurant Organization has selected potential countries where Japanese food is becoming increasingly popular, and conducted research concerning the Japanese restaurants abroad. These key nations or region are Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. This was meant as an effort to promote Japanese cuisine and to expand the market of Japanese ingredients, products and foodstuffs. Numbers of Japanese foodstuff and seasoning brands such as Ajinomoto, Kikkoman, Nissin and Kewpie mayonnaise, are establishing production base in other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\nUnited States\nThe California roll has been influential in sushi's global popularity; its invention often credited to a Japanese-born chef working in Los Angeles, with dates assigned to 1973, or even 1964. The dish has been snubbed by some purist sushi chefs, and also likened to the America-born chop suey by one scholar.\n\n the country has about 4,200 sushi restaurants. It is one of the most popular styles of sushi in the US market. Japanese cuisine is an integral part of food culture in Hawaii as well as in other parts of the United States. Popular items are sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki. Kamaboko, known locally as fish cake, is a staple of saimin, a noodle soup that is a local favorite in Hawaii. Sushi, long regarded as quite exotic in the west until the 1970s, has become a popular health food in parts of North America, Western Europe and Asia.\n\nTwo of the first Japanese restaurants in the United States were Saito and Nippon.  Restaurants such as these popularized dishes such as sukiyaki and tempura, while Nippon was the first restaurant in Manhattan to have a dedicated sushi bar.  Nippon was also one of the first Japanese restaurants in the U.S. to grow and process their own soba and responsible for creation of the now standard beef negimayaki dish.\n\nIn the U.S., the teppanyaki \"iron hot plate\" cooking restaurant took foothold. Such restaurants featured steak, shrimp and vegetables (including [[bean sprouts]), cooked in front of the customer on a \"teppanyaki grill\" (teppan) by a personal chef who turns cooking into performance art, twirling and juggling cutting knives like batons. The meal would be served with steamed rice and Japanese  soup. This style of cooking was made popular in the U.S. when Rocky Aoki founded his popular restaurant chain Benihana in 1964. In Japan this type of cooking is thought to be American food, but in the U.S. it is thought to be Japanese. Aoki thought this would go over better in the U.S. than traditional Japanese cuisine because he felt that Americans enjoyed \"eating in exotic surroundings, but are deeply mistrustful of exotic foods\u201d.\n\nCanada\n\nIn Canada, Japanese cuisine has become quite popular. Sushi, sashimi, and instant ramen are highly popular at opposite ends of the income scale, with instant ramen being a common low-budget meal. Sushi and sashimi takeout began in Vancouver and Toronto, and is now common throughout Canada. The largest supermarket chains all carry basic sushi and sashimi, and Japanese ingredients and instant ramen are readily available in most supermarkets. Most mid-sized mall food courts feature fast-food teppan cooking. Izakaya restaurants have surged in popularity.\n\nAustralia\nJapanese cuisine is very popular in Australia, and Australians are becoming increasingly familiar with traditional Japanese foods. Restaurants serving Japanese cuisine feature prominently in popular rankings, including Gourmet Traveller and The Good Food Guide.\n\nSushi in particular has been described as being \"as popular as sandwiches\", particularly in large cities like Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane. As such, sushi bars are a mainstay in shopping centre food courts, and are extremely common in cities and towns all over the country.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nJapanese food restaurant chains in the UK include Wagamama, YO! Sushi, Nudo Sushi Box, Wasabi and Kokoro.\n\nTaiwan\nJapan and Taiwan have shared close historical and cultural relations. Taiwan has adapted many Japanese food items. Tianbula, a Taiwanese version of tempura, only barely resembles the original, being more a variant of oden. Taiwanese Tianbula is prepared by boiling fish paste, dicing it into small pieces, and then coating it lightly with sweet chili sauce. Taiwanese versions of oden are known locally as olen.\n\nThailand\nIn Southeast Asia, Thailand is the largest market for Japanese food. This is partly because Thailand is a popular tourist destination, having large numbers of Japanese expatriates, as well as the local population having developed a taste for authentic Japanese cuisine. According to the Organisation that Promote Japanese Restaurants Abroad (JRO), the number of Japanese restaurants in Thailand jumped about 2.2-fold from 2007's figures to 1,676 in June 2012. In Bangkok, Japanese restaurants accounts for 8.3 percent of all restaurants, following those that serve Thai. Numbers of Japanese chain restaurants has established their business in Thailand, such as Yoshinoya gy\u016bdon restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku yakiniku restaurant chain and Kourakuen ramen restaurant chain.\n\nIndonesia\n\nIn the ASEAN region, Indonesia is the second largest market for Japanese food, after Thailand. Japanese cuisine has been increasingly popular as the growth of the Indonesian middle-class expecting higher quality foods. This is also contributed to the fact that Indonesia has large numbers of Japanese expatriates. The main concern is the halal issue. As a Muslim majority country, Indonesians expected that Japanese food served there are halal according to Islamic dietary law, which means no pork and alcohol allowed. Japanese restaurants in Indonesia often offer a set menu which include rice served with an array of Japanese favourites in a single setting. A set menu might include a choice of yakiniku or sukiyaki, including a sample of sushi, tempura, gyoza and miso soup. Quite authentic Japanese style izakaya and ramen shops can be found in Little Tokyo (Melawai) area in Blok M, South Jakarta, serving both Japanese expats and local clienteles. Today, Japanese restaurants can be found in most of Indonesian major cities, with high concentration in Greater Jakarta area, Bandung, Surabaya and Bali.\n\nIn some cases, Japanese cuisine in Indonesia is often slanted to suit Indonesian taste. Hoka Hoka Bento in particular is an Indonesian-owned Japanese fast food restaurant chain that cater to the Indonesian clientele. As a result the foods served there have been adapted to suit Indonesians' taste. Examples of the change include stronger flavours compared to the authentic subtle Japanese taste, the preference for fried food, as well as the addition of sambal to cater to the Indonesians' preference for hot and spicy food.\n\nJapanese food popularity also had penetrated street food culture, as modest Warjep or Warung Jepang (Japanese food stall) offer Japanese food such as tempura, okonomiyaki and takoyaki, at very moderately low prices. Today, okonomiyaki and takoyaki are popular street fare in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities. This is also pushed further by the Japanese convenience stores operating in Indonesia, such as 7-Eleven and Lawson offering Japanese favourites such as oden, chicken katsu (deep-fried chicken cutlet), chicken teriyaki and onigiri.\n\nSome chefs in Indonesian sushi establishment has created a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine, such as krakatau roll, gado-gado roll, rendang roll and gulai ramen. The idea of fusion cuisine between spicy Indonesian Padang and Japanese cuisine was thought because both cuisine traditions are well-liked by Indonesians. Nevertheless, some of these Japanese eating establishments might strive to serve authentic Japanese cuisine abroad. Numbers of Japanese chain restaurants has established their business in Indonesia, such as Yoshinoya gy\u016bdon restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku yakiniku restaurant chain and Ajisen Ramen restaurant chain.\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, Japanese cuisine is also popular among the local population. The Philippines have been exposed to the influences from the Japanese, Indian and Chinese. The cities of Davao and Metro Manila probably have the most Japanese influence in the country. The popular dining spots for Japanese nationals are located in Makati City, which is called as \"Little Tokyo\", a small area filled with restaurants specializing in different types of Japanese food. Some of the best Japanese no-frills restaurants in the Philippines can be found in Makati's \"Little Tokyo\" area.\n\nMexico\nIn Mexico, certain Japanese restaurants have created what is known as \"sushi Mexicano\", in which spicy sauces and ingredients accompany the dish or are integrated in sushi rolls. The habanero and serrano chiles have become nearly standard and are referred to as chiles toreados, as they are fried, diced and tossed over a dish upon request.\n\nBrazil\nIn Brazil, Japanese food is widespread due to the large Japanese-Brazilian population living in the country, which represents the largest Japanese community living outside Japan. Over the past years, many restaurant chains such as Koni Store have opened, selling typical dishes such as the popular temaki. Yakisoba, which is readily available in all supermarkets, and often included in non-Japanese restaurant menus.\n\nCultural heritage\nIn February 2012, the Agency for Cultural Affairs recommended that 'Washoku: Traditional Dietary Cultures of the Japanese' be added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. On December 4, 2013, \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures  of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year\" was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, bringing the number of Japanese assets listed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list to 22.\n\nFood controversies\n\nJapanese obsession with fresh food\u2014which manifested in certain aspect of Japanese cuisine traditions of eating live seafood, which includes Ikizukuri and Odori ebi, has gained criticism\u2014condemned as a form of animal cruelty.\n\nJapanese cuisine is heavily dependent on seafood products. Compared to other developed countries, the Japanese eat more fish than any of them, consuming about 27 kilograms of seafood per capita annually. An aspect of environmental concern is Japanese appetite for seafood, which might lead to depletion of natural ocean resources through overfishing. For example, Japan consumes 80% of the global supply of blue fin tuna, a popularly sought sushi and sashimi ingredient, which might lead to its extinction due to commercial overfishing. Another environmental concern is commercial whaling and the consumption of whale meat, since Japan is the world's largest market for whale meat.\n\nSee also\n\n Bento\n Culture of Japan\n Cuisine of Okinawa\n Fake food in Japan\n Honzen-ry\u014dri\n Japanese New Year\n Kaiseki\n List of Japanese condiments\n List of Japanese cooking utensils\n List of Japanese dishes\n List of Japanese desserts and sweets\n List of Japanese soups and stews\n List of Japanese ingredients\n List of Japanese restaurants\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n Gastronomic Japan\n\n*\n \nCategory:Asian cuisine\n"}, {"id": "BkksMSrxK0fuJQ42O-pr", "content": "Japanese regional cuisine\n\nJapanese cuisine has a vast array of regional specialities known as ky\u014ddo ry\u014dri (\u90f7\u571f\u6599\u7406) in Japanese, many of them originating from dishes prepared using local ingredients and traditional recipes.\n\nWhile \"local\" ingredients are now available nationwide, and some originally regional dishes such as okonomiyaki and Edo-style sushi have spread throughout Japan and is no longer considered as such, many regional specialities survive to this day, with some new ones still being created.\n\nRegionality is also apparent in many dishes which are served throughout Japan such as z\u014dni soup.

Many ingredients are added depending on regional and seasonal recipes, and personal preference.\n\nMiso soup is one of the two basic soup types of Japanese cuisine \u2013 the other one is suimono (clear soup).\n\nMiso paste \n\nThe choice of miso paste for the soup defines a great deal of its character and flavor. Miso pastes (a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, known in Japanese as k\u014djikin (\u9eb9\u83cc), and sometimes rice, barley, or other ingredients) can be categorized into red (akamiso), white (shiromiso), or mixed (awase). There are many variations within these themes, including regional variations, such as Shinsh\u016b miso or Sendai miso.\n\nA miso paste that has been fermented for a longer period of time, such as a red miso, gives the miso soup a stronger, deeper flavor. A miso paste that has been fermented for a shorter period of time, such as a white miso, provides a lighter, sweeter flavor.\n\nMore than 80% of Japan's total annual production of miso goes into miso soup, and 75% of all Japanese people consume miso soup at least once a day.\n\nStock \n\nThe most common dashi soup stocks for miso soup are made of niboshi (dried baby sardines), kombu (dried kelp), katsuobushi (thin shavings of dried and smoked bonito, aka skipjack tuna), or hoshi-shiitake (dried shiitake). The kombu can also be used in combination with katsuobushi or hoshi-shiitake. The kelp and/or shiitake dashi serve as a vegetarian soup stock.\n\nOutside Japan, American or European style miso soup is sometimes made by dissolving miso in a Western vegetable stock. The stock might include ingredients such as negi, carrot, potato and daikon radish. In some versions of the dish, chicken stock, Western-style fish stock, and other non-dashi bases can even be used, but there is some debate over whether or not miso soups made using these non-traditional bases count as true misoshiru. \n\nChristian Japanese refugees who came to the Philippines during the Edo period brought along miso soup.\n\nSolid ingredients \n\nAccording to Japanese custom, the solid ingredients are chosen to reflect the seasons and to provide contrasts of color, texture, and flavor. Thus negi and tofu, a strongly flavored ingredient mixed with a delicately flavored ingredient, are often combined. Ingredients that float, such as wakame seaweed, and ingredients that sink, such as potatoes, are also combined. Ingredients may include mushrooms, potatoes, seaweed, onion, shrimp, fish, clams, and sliced daikon. Nearly any Japanese ingredient is added to some type of miso soup. However, miso soup does not typically contain many ingredients beyond the stock and miso.\n\nIf pork is added to miso soup, it is called tonjiru, meaning \"pork soup\".\n\nPreparation and serving \nMiso soup can be prepared in several ways, depending on the chef and the style of soup. Japanese recipes usually call for most vegetables and meats to be cooked in the simmering dashi, particularly mushrooms, daikon, carrots, potatoes, tofu, and fish. The miso is suspended separately in some dashi stock removed from the simmering mix, to keep the miso paste from cooking, which alters the flavour, kills beneficial bacteria, and reduces the health benefits of biologically active miso paste. When the vegetables are cooked, the stock is removed from heat, the miso suspension is added and mixed into the soup, any uncooked ingredients are added, and the dish is served.\n\nIn Japan, miso soup and white rice make up the central dishes of the traditional Japanese breakfast. The soup has been a favorite of commoners and royalty alike for many centuries, but there are also many other dishes involving breakfast. They are all quite small, some include egg, fish, and natt\u014d which is a fermented soy bean. The soup is usually served in lacquer bowls with lids and drunk directly from the bowl, though the solid ingredients are eaten with chopsticks. The bowl sometimes has a lid to keep heat and aroma in as well as to improve the presentation.\n\nInstant miso soup \nInstant miso soup is available in single-serving packets. It is usually sold in dehydrated powder and paste forms, though it sometimes also sold freeze dried. It generally contains dried toppings such as wakame and tofu with soy beans that reconstitute rapidly on the addition of hot water. These are popular in the Japanese workplace, where miso soup can be made with lunch as easily as green tea and using the same water. Instant miso soup is available in many grocery stores outside Japan. It has a shelf life of 3 to 12 months.\n\nWappani\nWappani ( is a miso-soup-based dish unique to Awashima island off the coast of Niigata, Japan. A cedar flask (\"wappa\") is filled with miso soup, fish and vegetables and it is heated by dropping in hot rocks, which quickly bring it to a simmer. Hot rocks retain their heat for hours after being taken from the fire, so a hot meal can be prepared without the use of fire.\n\nHealth benefits \n\nIn 2003, researchers at Japan's National Cancer Centre suggested that \"eating three or more bowls of the Japanese delicacy Miso soup every day could cut women's risk of developing breast cancer\". Miso soup also tends to be low in calories, but is filling because of the high protein content.\n\nSee also \n List of Japanese soups and stews\n List of soups\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nCategory:Japanese soups and stews\nCategory:Vegetarian dishes of Japan\nCategory:Soy-based foods\n"}, {"id": "BkksMJfxK7Fh0PyaBLgF", "content": "Miso\n\nis a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and k\u014dji (the fungus Aspergillus oryzae) and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed or other ingredients. The result is a thick paste used for sauces and spreads, pickling vegetables or meats, and mixing with dashi soup stock to serve as miso soup called , a Japanese culinary staple. High in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals, miso played an important nutritional role in feudal Japan. Miso is still widely used in Japan, both in traditional and modern cooking, and has been gaining worldwide interest.\n\nTypically, miso is salty, but its flavor and aroma depend on various factors in the ingredients and fermentation process. Different varieties of miso have been described as salty, sweet, earthy, fruity, and savory.\n\nHistory\nThe origin of the miso of Japan is not completely clear. \nGrain and fish misos had been manufactured in Japan since the Neolithic era (J\u014dmon period (14,000\u2013300 BC)). These are called j\u014dmon miso and are similar to the early fish- and soy-based sauces produced throughout East Asia.\nThis miso predecessor originated in China during the third century BC or earlier. Hishio and other fermented soy-based foods likely were introduced to Japan at the same time as Buddhism in the sixth century AD. This fermented food was called shi.\n    \nIn the Kamakura period (1192\u20131333), a common meal was made up of a bowl of rice, some dried fish, a serving of miso, and a fresh vegetable. Until the Muromachi period (1337 to 1573), miso was made without grinding the soybeans, somewhat like natt\u014d. In the Muromachi era, Buddhist monks discovered that soybeans could be ground into a paste, spawning new cooking methods using miso to flavor other foods. In medieval times, the word temaemiso, meaning home-made miso, appeared. Miso production is a relatively simple process, so home-made versions spread throughout Japan. Miso was used as military provisions during the Sengoku period, and making miso was an important economic activity for daimy\u014ds of that era.\n\nDuring the Edo period (1603\u20131868), miso was also called hishio (\u91a4) and kuki (\u8c46\u652f) and various types of miso that fit with each local climate and culture emerged throughout Japan.\n\nToday, miso is produced industrially in large quantities, and traditional home-made miso has become a rarity. In recent years, many new types of miso have appeared, including ones with added soup stocks or calcium, or made with beans other than soy, or having reduced salt for health, among other varieties, are available.\n\nIngredients\nThe ingredients used to produce miso may include any mix of soybeans, barley, rice, buckwheat, millet, rye, wheat, hemp seed, and cycad, among others. Lately, producers in other countries have also begun selling miso made from chickpeas, corn, azuki beans, amaranth, and quinoa. Fermentation time ranges from as little as five days to several years. The wide variety of Japanese miso is difficult to classify, but is commonly done by grain type, color, taste, and background.\nmugi (\u9ea6): barley\ntsubu (\u7c92): whole wheat/barley\ngenmai (\u7384\u7c73): brown rice\nmoromi (\u91aa): chunky, healthy (k\u014dji is unblended)\nnanban (\u5357\u86ee): mixed with hot chili pepper for dipping sauce\ntaima (\u5927\u9ebb): hemp seed\nsobamugi (\u854e\u9ea6): buckwheat\nhadakamugi (\u88f8\u9ea6): Highland barley\nnari (\u8607\u9244): made from cycad pulp, Buddhist temple diet\ngokoku (\u4e94\u7a40): \"five-grain\": soy, wheat, barley, proso millet, and foxtail millet\n\nMany regions have their own specific variation on the miso standard. For example, the soybeans used in Sendai miso are much more coarsely mashed than in normal soy miso.\n\nMiso made with rice such as shinshu and shiro are called kome miso.\n\nTypes and flavor\n\nThe taste, aroma, texture, and appearance of miso all vary by region and season. Other important variables that contribute to the flavor of a particular miso include temperature, duration of fermentation, salt content, variety of k\u014dji, and fermenting vessel. The most common flavor categories of miso are:\nShiromiso, \"white miso\"\nAkamiso, \"red miso\"\nAwasemiso, \"mixed miso\"\n\nAlthough white and red (shiromiso and akamiso) are the most common types of misos available, different varieties may be preferred in particular regions of Japan. In the eastern Kant\u014d region that includes Tokyo, the darker brownish akamiso is popular while in the western Kansai region encompassing Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, the lighter shiromiso is preferred.\n\nA more nuanced breakdown of the flavors is:\n\nKome miso (\u7c73\u5473\u564c) or \"rice miso\" can be yellow, yellowish white, red, etc. Whitish miso is made from boiled soybeans, and reddish miso is made from steamed soybeans. Kome miso is consumed more in eastern Japan and the Hokuriku and Kinki areas.\nMugi miso (\u9ea6\u5473\u564c) or \"barley miso\" is a whitish miso which is produced in Kyushu, western Chugoku, and Shikoku areas. Another reddish mugi miso is produced in the northern Kanto area. Mugi miso has a peculiar smell.\nMame miso (\u8c46\u5473\u564c) or \"soybean miso\" is a darker, more reddish brown than kome miso. This is not so sweet as some other varieties, but has some astringency and good umami(\u65e8\u5473). This miso requires a long maturing term. Mame miso is consumed mostly in Aichi prefecture, part of Gifu prefecture, and part of Mie prefecture. Soybean (grain-free) miso is also labeled hatch\u014d miso. Hatch\u014d miso is an Okazaki, Aichi specialty and has its origins in Mikawa Province during the Sengoku period. The processing method with large wooden barrels and stones on the lid remains unchanged.\nCh\u014dg\u014d (\u8abf\u5408) or Awase (\u5408\u308f\u305b) miso, or \"mixed miso\" comes in many types, because it is a mixture or compound of other varieties of miso. This may improve the weak points of each type of miso. For example, mame miso is very salty, but when combined with kome miso the finished product has a mild taste.\nAkamiso (\u8d64\u5473\u564c) or red miso is aged, sometimes for more than one year. Therefore, due to the Maillard reaction, the color changes gradually from white to red or black, thus giving it the name red miso. Characteristics of the flavor are saltiness and some astringency with umami. It is often a much stronger-tasting miso. Factors in the depth of color are the formula of the soybeans and the quantity used. Generally, steamed soybeans are more deeply colored than boiled soybeans.\nShiromiso (\u767d\u5473\u564c) or white miso is the most widely produced miso, made in many regions of the country. Its main ingredients are rice, barley, and a small quantity of soybeans. If a greater quantity of soybeans were added, the miso would be red or brown. Compared with red miso, white miso has a very short fermentation time. The taste is sweet, and the umami is soft or light (compared to red miso).\n\nChemical Properties of Flavor and Aroma Compounds \nThe distinct and unique aroma of miso determines its quality. Many reactions occur among the components of miso, primarily the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic reaction of an amino group with a reducing sugar. The volatile compounds produced from this reaction give miso its characteristic flavor and aroma. Depending on the microorganism in combination with the variety of soybean or cereal used, many classes of flavor compounds are produced that give rise to the different types of miso. Fermentation products such as furanone compounds, including 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (HEMF) and 4-hydroxy-2,5 dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (HDMF) are novel flavor compounds of miso. HEMF is especially known for its sweet aroma and is very important for the sensory evaluation of the aroma of rice miso.\n\nThe unique sensory properties of miso are complex; however, the key factor involved in the overall quality of the final product is the enzymatic activity of microorganisms. They use the composition of miso (rice, barley, and soybeans) to produce different pigments, flavor and aroma compounds.\n\nProteolysis of soybean protein produces constituent amino acids that impart an umami taste that enhance the relatively dull taste of soybean by itself. Soy protein contains a substantial amount of glutamate, the salt of which is known as MSG or monosodium glutamate, a popular ingredient used by food manufacturers to improve the taste of their products. The umami effect of MSG itself is one-dimensional; however the umami taste of miso is multi-dimensional because of the myriad of different amino acids and fermentation products present.\n\nBarley miso is a traditional farmhouse variety made for personal use. Often called \u201crural miso\u201d, domestic barley is more often used than imported barley. Containing glutamic acid and aromatic compounds such as ferulic acid and vanillic acid, barley miso is distinguished by a characteristic flavor.\n\nFermentation \nMiso's unique properties and flavour profile can be attributed to the compounds produced through the fermentation process. Miso, depending on the variety, consists of a starter culture called koji, soybeans, and usually a grain (either rice, barley, or rye). The miso goes through a two step process; first creating the koji, and second the koji is combined with the other components and the mixture is left to be enzymatically digested, fermented and aged.\n\nCreating koji \nKoji is produced by introducing the mould Aspergillus oryzae onto steamed white rice. This mould culture comes from dried A. oryzae spores called tane-koji or \"starter koji\" and is isolated from plant matter (usually rice) and cultivated. In the past, the natural presence of A. oryzae spores was relied upon to create koji, but because of the difficulty of producing the culture, tane-koji is added almost exclusively in both industrial and traditional production of miso. Tane-koji is produced much in the same way as koji, but also has a small portion of wood ash added to the mixture which gives important nutrients to the fungus as well as promoting sporulation.\n\nA. oryzae is an aerobic fungus and is the most active fermenting agents in koji as it produces amylolytic, and proteolytic enzymes which are essential to creating the final miso product. Amyloytic enzymes such as amylase aid in the breakdown of starch in the grains to sugar and dextrin, while proteolytic enzymes such as protease catalyze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. These both aid in the enzymatic digestion of the mixture of rice and soybeans. Depending on the strain of A. oryzae, enzymatic composition varies thereby changing the characteristics of the final miso product. For example, the strain used to create the sweeter white miso would likely produce a higher content of amylolytic enzymes, while comparatively a soybean miso might have a higher content of proteolytic enzyme.\n\nTo create optimal conditions for enzymatic production and the growth of A. oryzae, the koji's environment must be carefully regulated. Temperature, humidity and oxygen content, are all important factors in not only maximizing mould growth and enzyme production, but to prevent other harmful bacteria from producing. Once the koji has reached a desirable flavour profile it is usually mixed with salt to prevent further fermentation.\n\nAlthough other strains of fungi have been used to produce koji, A. oryzae is the most desirable because of a number of properties, including the fact that it does not produce aflatoxin.\n\nStorage and preparation\nMiso typically comes as a paste in a sealed container requiring refrigeration after opening. Natural miso is a living food containing many beneficial microorganisms such as Tetragenococcus halophilus which can be killed by overcooking. For this reason, the miso should be added to soups or other foods being prepared just before they are removed from the heat.  Using miso without any cooking may be even better. Outside Japan, a popular practice is to add miso only to foods that have cooled to preserve k\u014djikin cultures in miso. Nonetheless, miso and soy foods play a large role in the Japanese diet, and many cooked miso dishes are popular.\n\nUsage\n\nMiso is a part of many Japanese-style meals. It most commonly appears as the main ingredient of miso soup, which is eaten daily by much of the Japanese population. The pairing of plain rice and miso soup is considered a fundamental unit of Japanese cuisine. This pairing is the basis of a traditional Japanese breakfast.\n\nMiso is used in many other types of soup and soup-like dishes, including some kinds of ramen, udon, nabe, and imoni. Generally, such dishes have the title miso prefixed to their name (for example, miso-udon), and have a heavier, earthier flavor and aroma compared to other Japanese soups that are not miso-based.\n\nMany traditional confections use a sweet, thick miso glaze, such as mochidango. Miso-glazed treats are strongly associated with Japanese festivals, although they are available year-round at supermarkets. The consistency of miso glaze ranges from thick and taffy-like to thin and drippy.\n\nSoy miso is used to make a type of pickle called misozuke. These pickles are typically made from cucumber, daikon, Nappa cabbage, or eggplant, and are sweeter and less salty than the standard Japanese salt pickle.\n\nOther foods with miso as an ingredient include:\n dengaku (sweetened miso used for grilling)\n yakimochi  (charcoal-grilled mochi covered in miso)\n miso-braised vegetables or mushrooms\n marinades: fish or chicken can be marinated in miso and sake overnight to be grilled.\n corn on the cob in Japan is often coated with shiro miso, wrapped in foil and grilled.\n sauces: sauces like misoyaki (a variant on teriyaki) \n dips: used as a dip to eat with vegetables (e.g. cucumbers, daikon, carrots, etc.)\n side dish: miso is often eaten not only as a condiment, but also as a side dish. Mixed or cooked miso with spices or vegetables is called okazu-miso (\u304a\u304b\u305a\u5473\u564c), often eaten along with hot rice or spread over onigiri.Nutrition and health\nClaims that miso is high in vitamin B12 have been contradicted in some studies.\n\nSome experts suggest that miso is a source of Lactobacillus acidophilus. Miso is relatively high in salt which can contribute to increased blood pressure in the small percentage of the population with sodium-sensitive prehypertension or hypertension.\n\nSee alsoDoubanjiang\nDoenjang\nHozon\nFermented bean paste\nList of fermented soy productsMarukome\nSoy sauce\n''Tauco\nYellow soybean paste\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nMiso Online Japan Miso Promotion Board\n\nCategory:Fermented soy-based foods\nCategory:Japanese condiments\nCategory:Umami enhancers\nCategory:Japanese cuisine terms\nCategory:Food paste\n"}, {"id": "BkksLJnxK4sOkoZ__tER", "content": "Misu\n\nMisu () is a beverage made from Korean traditional grain powder, misu-garu (; misutgaru; \"misu powder\") which is a combination of 7\u201310 different grains.

Chinese noodles vary widely according to the region of production, ingredients, shape or width, and manner of preparation. They are an important part of most regional cuisines within China, as well as in Singapore, and other Southeast Asian nations with sizable overseas Chinese populations.\n\nChinese-style noodles have also entered the cuisines of neighboring East Asian countries such as Korea (jajangmyeon) and Japan (ramen), as well as Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam (h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu and m\u00ec x\u00e0o are both examples of Vietnamese dishes that are of Chinese origin), Cambodia (Kuy teav) and Thailand.\n\nNomenclature\nNomenclature of Chinese noodles can be difficult due to the vast spectrum available in China and the many dialects of Chinese used to name them. In Mandarin, mi\u00e0n (; often transliterated as \"mien\" or \"mein\" ) refers to noodles made from wheat flour, while f\u011bn () or \"fun\" refers to noodles made from other starches, particularly rice flour and mung bean starch. Each noodle type can be rendered in pinyin for Mandarin, but in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong it will be known by its Cantonese pronunciation (\"meen\" or \"mien\" for wheat noodles, \"fun\" for non-wheat). Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and many other Overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia may use Hokkien (Min Nan) instead (e.g. \"mee\" for wheat noodles).\n\nHistory\nThe earliest written record of noodles is from a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25\u2013220 CE). Noodles, often made from wheat dough, became a prominent staple of food during the Han dynasty. In the Western Han Dynasty, due to the demand for military, it was necessary for the Government to implement food processing technologies that would make the food storage easier and more affordable. During this time, \u201cLaomian\u201d was emerged, it was made with starch rich buckwheat, millet and pea, flours. It consists lower water content making it easier to store and transport around.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) noodle shops were very popular in the cities, and remained open all night. During the earlier dynastic periods Chinese wheat noodles were known as \"soup cake\" (\u6e6f\u9905), as explained by the Song dynasty scholar Huang Chaoying (\u9ec3\u671d\u82f1) mentions in his work \"A delightful mixed discussion on various scholarly topics\" (, Scroll 2) that in ancient times bready foods like pasta are referred collectively as \"bing\" and differentiated through their cooking methods.\u00b7\n\nProduction\nChinese noodles are generally made from either wheat flour, rice flour, or mung bean starch, with wheat noodles being more commonly produced and consumed in northern China and rice noodles being more typical of southern China. Egg, lye, and cereal may also be added to noodles made from wheat flour in order to give the noodles a different color or flavor. Egg whites, arrowroot or tapioca starch are sometimes added to the flour mixture in low quantities to change the texture and tenderness of the noodles' strands. Although illegal, the practice of adding the chemical cross-linker borax to whiten noodles and improve their texture is also quite common in East Asia. In general, the chinese noodles cooking method involves making a dough with flour, salt, and water; mixing the dough by hand to form bar shapes; bending the bars for proofing; pulling the bars into strips; dropping the strips into a pot with boiling water; and removing the noodles when finished cooking. Chinese type noodles are generally made from hard wheat flours, characterized by bright creamy white or bright yellow color and firm texture. \n\nBefore the automatic noodle machine was invented in 1950s, the processing of Chinese noodles were made with four steps, including Fresh - The noodles are often consumed within 24 hours of manufacture due to quick discoloration. Their shelf life can be extended to 3-5 days if stored under refrigeration; Dried - Fresh noodle stands are dried by sunlight or in a controlled chamber. Chinese noodles, can be in dried form; Boiled - Fresh noodle strands are either parboiled or fully cooked. After parboiling, Chinese noodles are rinsed in cold water, drained and covered with 1-2% vegetable oil to prevent sticking; Steamed - Fresh alkaline noodle strands are steamed in a steamer and softened with water through rinsing.\n\nThe dough for noodles made from wheat flour is typically made from wheat flour, salt, and water, with the addition of eggs or lye depending on the desired texture and taste of the noodles. Rice- or other starch-based noodles are typically made with only the starch or rice flour and water. After the formation of a pliable dough mass, one of five types of mechanical processing may be applied to produce the noodles:\n\nWhile cut and extruded noodles can be dried to create a shelf-stable product to be eaten months after production, most peeled, pulled and kneaded noodles are consumed shortly after they are produced.\n\nCooking\n\nNoodles may be cooked from either their fresh (moist) or dry forms. They are generally boiled, although they may also be deep-fried in oil until crispy. Boiled noodles may then be stir fried, served with sauce or other accompaniments, or served in soup, often with meat and other ingredients. Certain rice-noodles are made directly from steaming the raw rice slurry and are only consumed fresh.\n\nUnlike many Western noodles and pastas, Chinese noodles made from wheat flour are usually made from salted dough, and therefore do not require the addition of salt to the liquid in which they are boiled. Chinese noodles also cook very quickly, generally requiring less than 5 minutes to become al dente and some taking less than a minute to finish cooking, with thinner noodles requiring less time to cook. Chinese noodles made from rice or mung bean starch do not generally contain salt.\n\nTypes\n\nWheat\nThese noodles are made only with wheat flour and water. If the intended product is dried noodles, salt is almost always added to the recipe.\n\nLye-water or egg\nThese wheat flour noodles are more chewy in texture and yellow in colour either due to the addition of lye (sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide) and/or egg. This class of lye water noodles () has a subtle but distinctive smell and taste, described by some as being \"eggy\".\n\nRice\nRice-based noodles can be: \nExtruded from a paste and steamed into strands of noodles\nSteamed from a slurry into sheets and then sliced into strands\nThese noodles are typically made only with rice and water without the addition of salt. Although unorthodox, some producers may choose to add other plant starches to modify the texture of the noodles.\n\nStarch\n\nThese noodles are made using various plant starches. Mung bean starch noodles will often be cut with tapioca starch to make them more chewy and reduce production costs.\n\nOat\n\nIn China, particularly in western Inner Mongolia and Shanxi province, oat (Avena nuda) flour is called youmian (\u839c\u9762), and is processed into noodles or thin-walled rolls, which are consumed as staple food. The process of making oat noodles is special. The oat dough is twisted on marble plate which can ensure the dough will not stick on it, into strips and thin-rolls. It can be boiled and also steamed with different sauces to eat.\n\nChinese noodle dishes\nThe following are a small portion of Chinese dishes that incorporate noodles:\nBan mian\nBeef chow fun\nCart noodle\nChar kway teow\nLaksa\nLo mein\nRe gan mian\nZhajiangmian\n\nSee also\n\n Chinese cuisine\n Japanese noodles\n Korean noodles\n List of noodles\n List of noodle dishes\n Noodle soup\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Cook's Thesaurus: Asian Noodles\n\n \nCategory:Articles containing video clips\n"}, {"id": "BkksKQvxK6wApjhAfjQ8", "content": "Chinese cuisine\n\nChinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.\n\nThe preference for seasoning and cooking techniques of Chinese provinces depend on differences in historical background and ethnic groups. Geographic features including mountains, rivers, forests and deserts also have a strong effect on the local available ingredients, considering that the climate of China varies from tropical in the south to subarctic in the northeast. Imperial, royal and noble preference also plays a role in the change of Chinese cuisines. Because of imperial expansion and trading, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time.\n\nThe most praised \"Four Major Cuisines\" are Chuan, Lu, Yue and Huaiyang, representing West, North, South and East China cuisine correspondingly. The modern \"Eight Cuisines\" of China are Anhui (), Cantonese (), Fujian (), Hunan (), Jiangsu (), Shandong (), Sichuan (), and Zhejiang () cuisines.\n\nColor, smell and taste are the three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food, as well as the meaning, appearance and nutrition of the food. Cooking should be appraised with respect to the ingredients used, knifework, cooking time and seasoning.\n\nHistory \n\nChinese society greatly valued gastronomy, and developed an extensive study of the subject based on its traditional medical beliefs.  Chinese culture initially centered around the North China Plain. The first domesticated crops seem to have been the foxtail and broomcorn varieties of millet, while rice was cultivated in the south. By 2000 BC, wheat had arrived from western Asia. These grains were typically served as warm noodle soups instead of baked into bread as in Europe. Nobles hunted various wild game and consumed mutton, pork and dog as these animals were domesticated. Grain was stored against famine and flood and meat was preserved with salt, vinegar, curing, and fermenting. The flavor of the meat was enhanced by cooking it in animal fats though this practice was mostly restricted to the wealthy.\n\nBy the time of Confucius in the late Zhou, gastronomy had become a high art. Confucius discussed the principles of dining: \"The rice would never be too white, the meat would never be too finely cut... When it was not cooked right, man would not eat. When it was cooked bad, man would not eat. When the meat was not cut properly, man would not eat. When the food was not prepared with the right sauce, man would not eat. Although there are plenty of meats, they should not be cooked more than staple food. There is no limit for alcohol, before a man gets drunk.\" During Shi Huangdi's Qin dynasty, the empire expanded into the south. By the time of the Han dynasty, the different regions and cuisines of China's people were linked by major canals and leading to a greater complexity in the different regional cuisines. Not only is food seen as giving \"qi\", energy, but food is also about maintaining yin and yang. The philosophy behind it was rooted in the I Ching and Chinese traditional medicine: food was judged for color, aroma, taste, and texture and a good meal was expected to balance the Four Natures ('hot', warm, cool, and 'cold') and the Five Tastes (pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). Salt was used as a preservative from early times, but in cooking was added in the form of soy sauce, and not at the table. The predominance of chopsticks and spoons as eating utensils also necessitated that most food be prepared in bite-sized pieces or (as with fish) be so tender that it could be easily picked apart.\n\nBy the Later Han period (2nd century), writers frequently complained of lazy aristocrats who did nothing but sit around all day eating smoked meats and roasts.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed methods of food preservation for military rations during campaigns such as drying meat into jerky and cooking, roasting, and drying grain.\nChinese legends claim that the roasted, flat bread shaobing was brought back from the Xiyu (the Western Regions, a name for Central Asia) by the Han dynasty General Ban Chao, and that it was originally known as hubing (, lit. \"barbarian bread\"). The shaobing is believed to be descended from the hubing. Shaobing is believed to be related to the Persian nan and Central Asian nan, as well as the Middle Eastern pita. Foreign westerners made and sold sesame cakes in China during the Tang dynasty.\n\nDuring the Southern and Northern Dynasties non-Han people like the Xianbei of Northern Wei introduced their cuisine to northern China, and these influences continued up to the Tang dynasty, popularizing meat like mutton and dairy products like goat milk, yogurts, and Kumis among even Han people. It was during the Song dynasty that Han Chinese developed an aversion to dairy products and abandoned the dairy foods introduced earlier.\n\nThe Han Chinese rebel Wang Su who received asylum in the Xianbei Northern Wei after fleeing from Southern Qi, at first could not stand eating dairy products like goat's milk and meat like mutton and had to consume tea and fish instead, but after a few years he was able to eat yogurt and lamb, and the Xianbei Emperor asked him which of the foods of China (Zhongguo) he preferred, fish vs mutton and tea vs yogurt.\n\nThe great migration of Chinese people south during the invasions preceding and during the Song dynasty increased the relative importance of southern Chinese staples such as rice and congee. Su Dongpo has improved the red braised pork as Dongpo pork.\n\nThe Yuan and Qing dynasties introduced Mongolian and Manchu cuisine, warm northern dishes that popularized hot pot cooking. During the Yuan dynasty many Muslim communities emerged in China, who practiced a porkless cuisine now preserved by Hui restaurants throughout the country. Yunnan cuisine is unique in China for its cheeses like Rubing and Rushan cheese made by the Bai people, and its yogurt, the yogurt may have been due to a combination of Mongolian influence during the Yuan dynasty, the Central Asian settlement in Yunnan, and the proximity and influence of India and Tibet on Yunnan.\n\nAs part of the last leg of the Columbian Exchange, Spanish and Portuguese traders began introducing foods from the New World to China through the port cities of Canton and Macau. Mexican chili peppers became essential ingredients in Sichuan cuisine and calorically-dense potatoes and corn became staple foods across the northern plains.\n\nDuring the Qing Dynasty, Chinese gastronomes such as Yuan Mei focused upon a primary goal of extracting the maximum flavor of each ingredient. As noted in his culinary work the Suiyuan shidan, however, the fashions of cuisine at the time were quite varied and in some cases were flamboyantly ostentatious, especially when the display served also a formal ceremonial purpose, as in the case of the Manchu Han Imperial Feast.\n\nAs the pace of life increases in modern China, fast food like fried noodles, fried rice and gaifan (dish over rice) become more and more popular.\n\nRegional cuisines\n\nThere are a variety of styles of cooking in China, but Chinese chefs have classified eight regional cuisines according to their distinct tastes and local characteristics. A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine but perhaps the best known and most influential are Cantonese cuisine, Shandong cuisine, Jiangsu cuisine (specifically Huaiyang cuisine) and Sichuan cuisine. These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as availability of resources, climate, geography, history, cooking techniques and lifestyle. One style may favour the use of garlic and shallots over chili and spices, while another may favour preparing seafood over other meats and fowl. Jiangsu cuisine favours cooking techniques such as braising and stewing, while Sichuan cuisine employs baking. Zhejiang cuisine focuses more on serving fresh food and is more like Japanese food. Fujian cuisine is famous for its delicious seafood and soups and the precise use of scintillating spices. Hunan cuisine is famous for its hot and sour taste. Anhui cuisine incorporates wild food for an unusual taste and is wilder than Fujian cuisine. \n\nBased on the raw materials and ingredients used, the method of preparation and cultural differences, a variety of foods with different flavors and textures are prepared in different regions of the country. Many traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of preservation such as drying, salting, pickling and fermentation.\n\nIn addition, the \"rice theory\" attempts to describe cultural differences between north and south China; in the north, noodles are more consumed due to wheat being widely grown whereas in the south, rice is more preferred as it has historically been more cultivated there.\n\nStaple foods\n\nChinese ancestors successfully planted millet, rice, and other grains about 9,000 and 8,000 years ago. As for wheat, another staple, it took another three or four thousand years. For the first time, grains provided people with a steady supply of food. Because of the lack of food, Chinese people have to adapt to the new eating habits. The meat was scarce at that time, so people cooked with small amounts of meat and rice or noodles.\n\nRice\nRice is a major staple food for people from rice farming areas in southern China. Steamed rice, usually white rice, is the most commonly eaten form. People in southern China also like to use rice to make congee as breakfast. Rice is also used to produce beer, baijiu and vinegars.   Glutinous rice (\"sticky rice\") is a variety of rice used in specialty dishes such as lotus leaf rice and glutinous rice balls.\n\nWheat\nIn wheat-farming areas in Northern China, people largely rely on flour-based food, such as noodles, bing (bread), jiaozi (a kind of Chinese dumplings), and mantou (a type of steamed buns).\n\nNoodles\n\nChinese noodles come dry or fresh in a variety of sizes, shapes and textures and are often served in soups or fried as toppings. Some varieties, such as Shou Mian (\u5bff\u9762, literally noodles of longevity), is an avatar of long life and good health according to Chinese traditions. Noodles can be served hot or cold with different toppings, with broth, and occasionally dry (as is the case with mi-fen).  Noodles are commonly made with rice flour or wheat flour, but other flours such as soybean are also used in minor groups.\n\nSoybean products\n\nTofu is made of soybeans and is another popular food product that supplies protein. The production process of tofu varies from region to region, resulting in different kinds of tofu with a wide range of texture and taste. Other products such as soy milk, soy paste, soy oil, and fermented soy sauce are also important in Chinese cooking.\n\nThere are many kinds of soybean products, including tofu skin, smoked tofu, dried tofu, and fried tofu.\n\nStinky tofu is fermented tofu. Like blue cheese or durian, it has a very distinct, potent and strong smell, and is an acquired taste. Hard stinky tofu is often deep-fried and paired with soy sauce or salty spice. Soft stinky tofu are usually used as a spread on steamed buns.\n\nDoufuru is another type of fermented tofu that has a salty taste. Doufuru can be pickled together with soy beans, red yeast rice or chili to create different color and flavor. This is more of a pickled type of tofu and is not as strongly scented as stinky tofu.  Doufuru has the consistency of slightly soft blue cheese, and a taste similar to Japanese miso paste, but less salty. Doufuru can be used as a spread on steamed buns, or paired with rice congee.\n\nVegetables\nApart from vegetables that can be commonly seen, some unique vegetables used in Chinese cuisine include baby corn, bok choy, snow peas, Chinese eggplant, Chinese broccoli, and straw mushrooms.  Other vegetables including bean sprouts, pea vine tips, watercress, lotus roots, water chestnuts, and bamboo shoots are also used in different cuisines of China.\n\nBecause of different climate and soil conditions, cultivars of green beans, peas, and mushrooms can be found in rich variety.\n\nA variety of dried or pickled vegetables are also processed, especially in drier or colder regions where fresh vegetables were hard to get out of season.\n\nHerbs and seasonings\n\nSeasonings such as fresh ginger root, garlic, scallion, cilantro and sesame are widely used in many regional cuisines. Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon, fennel, cloves and white peppers are also used in different regions.\n\nTo add extra flavors to dishes, many Chinese cuisines also contain dried Chinese mushrooms, dried baby shrimp, dried tangerine peel,<ref name=nytimes>Chinese Restaurants Are Adding Herbs for Flavor and Health \u2013 The New York Times</ref> and dried Sichuan chillies.\n\nWhen it comes to sauces, China is home to soy sauce, which is made from fermented soybeans and wheat. A number of sauces are also based on fermented soybeans, including hoisin sauce, ground bean sauce and yellow bean sauce. There are also different sauces preferred by regional cuisines, oyster sauce, fish sauce and furu (fermented tofu) are also widely used. Vinegar also has a variety with different flavors: clear rice vinegar, Chinkiang black rice vinegar, Shanxi vinegar, Henghe vinegar etc.\n\nDesserts and snacks\n\nGenerally, seasonal fruits serve as the most common form of dessert consumed after dinner.\n\nDim sum (\u9ede\u5fc3), originally means small portion of food, can refer to dessert, pastries. Later to avoid the disambiguation, tian dian (\u751c\u9ede) and gao dian (\u7cd5\u9ede) are used to describe desserts and pastries.\n\nChinese desserts are sweet foods and dishes that are served with tea, usually during the meal, or at the end of meals in Chinese cuisine.\n\nBesides served as a dim sum along with tea, pastries are used for celebration of traditional festivals. The most famous one is moon cake, used to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\nA wide variety of Chinese desserts are available, mainly including steamed and boiled sweet snacks. Bing is an umbrella term for all breads in Chinese, also including pastries and sweets. These are baked wheat flour based confections, with different stuffings including red bean paste, jujube and various of others. Su (\u9165) is another kind of pastry made with more amount of oil, making the confection more friable. Chinese candies and sweets, called t\u00e1ng (\u7cd6)  are usually made with cane sugar, malt sugar, honey, nuts and fruit. Gao or Guo are rice based snacks that are typically steamed and may be made from glutinous or normal rice.\n\nAnother cold dessert is called baobing, which is shaved ice with sweet syrup. Chinese jellies are known collectively in the language as ices. Many jelly desserts are traditionally set with agar and are flavored with fruits, though gelatin based jellies are also common in contemporary desserts.\n\nChinese dessert soups are typically sweet and served hot.\n\nThere are also western pastries in China, like mille-feuille, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cheesecake, but they are generally not as popular because the Chinese preference of dessert is mildly sweet and less oily.\n\nMany types of street foods, which vary from region to region, can be eaten as snacks or light dinner. Prawn crackers are an often-consumed snack in Southeast China.\n\nDairy products\nChinese in earlier dynasties evidently drank milk and ate dairy products, although not necessarily from cows, but perhaps koumiss (fermented mare's milk) or goat's milk.\n\nMany Chinese have until recently avoided milk, partly because pasturage for milk producers in a monsoon rice ecology is not economic, and partly because of the high rate of lactose intolerance among the Chinese population. As such the use of dairy products in Chinese cuisine has historically been rare, with regional exceptions such as the \"double skin milk\" dessert in Guangdong Province or the Rubing (milk cake) cheese in Yunnan. Today ice cream is commonly available and popular throughout China.\n\n Cold dishes \n\nCold dishes are usually served before the main meal. Besides salad and pickles as appetizers, they can range from jelly, beancurd, noodle salad, cooked meat and sausages, to jellyfish or cold soups.\n\nChinese sausages vary from region to region. The most common sausage is made of pork and pork fat. Flavor is generally salty-sweet in Southern China. In other parts of China, sausages are salted to be preserved. Chinese sausage is prepared in many different ways, including oven-roasting, stir-fry, and steaming.\n\nSoups\n\nIn some part of South China, soups are served between the cold dishes and the main dishes. In other parts of China, soups are served between the main dish and staple foods, before desserts or fruit salad. There are many traditional Chinese soups, such as wonton soup, herbal chicken soup, hot and sour soup, winter melon soup and so on.\n\nDrinks\nTea plays an important role in Chinese dining culture. Baijiu and huangjiu as strong alcoholic beverages are preferred by many people as well. Wine is not so popular as other drinks in China that are consumed whilst dining, although they are usually available in the menu.\n\nTea\n\nAs well as with dim sum, many Chinese drink their tea with snacks such as nuts, plums, dried fruit (in particular jujube), small sweets, melon seeds, and waxberry. China was the earliest country to cultivate and drink tea, which is enjoyed by people from all social classes. Tea processing began after the Qin and Han Dynasties.\n\nThe different types of Chinese tea include black, white, green, yellow, oolong, and dark tea. Chinese tea is often classified into several different categories according to the species of plant from which it is sourced, the region in which it is grown, and the method of production used. Some of these types are green tea, oolong tea, black tea, scented tea, white tea, and compressed tea. There are four major tea plantation regions: Jiangbei, Jiangnan, Huanan and the southwestern region. Well known types of green tea include Longjing, Huangshan, Mao Feng, Bilochun, Putuofeng Cha, and Liu'an Guapian. China is the world's largest exporter of green tea.\n\nOne of the most ubiquitous accessories in modern China, after a wallet or purse and an umbrella, is a double-walled insulated glass thermos with tea leaves in the top behind a strainer.\n\nAlcoholic beverages\n\nThe importance of baijiu (lit. \"white liquor\") in China (99.5% of its alcoholic market) makes it the most-consumed alcoholic spirit in the world. It dates back to the introduction of distilling during the Song dynasty; can be made from wheat, corn, or rice; and is usually around 120 proof (60% ABV). The most ubiquitous brand is the cheap Er guo tou, but Mao Tai is the premium baijiu. Other popular brands Kang, Lu Zhou Te Qu, and Wu Liang Ye.Huangjiu (lit. \"yellow liquor\") is not distilled and is a strong rice wine (10\u201315% ABV). Popular brands include Shaoxing Lao Jiu, Shaoxing Hua Diao, and Te Jia Fan.\n\nHerbal drinks\n\nChinese herb tea, also known as medicinal herbal tea, is a kind of tea made from Chinese medicinal herbs.\n\nOther beverages\nSoy milk, almond milk, walnut milk and coconut milk are also drunk during the meal in different regions. In some parts of China, hawthorn and jujube juice are preferred.  A small shot of fruit vinegar is served as an appetizer in Shanxi.\n\nChinese cuisines outside China\n\nWhere there are historical immigrant Chinese populations, the style of food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or lesser extents. This has resulted in a deep Chinese influence on other national cuisines such as Cambodian cuisine, Filipino cuisine, Thai cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine. There are also a large number of forms of fusion cuisine, often popular in the country in question. Some, such as ramen (Japanese Chinese cuisine) have become popular internationally.\n\nDeep fried meat combined with sweet and sour sauce as a cooking style receives an enormous preference outside of China. Therefore, many similar international Chinese cuisines are invented based on sweet and sour sauce, including Sweet and sour chicken (Europe and North America), Manchurian chicken (India) or tangsuyuk (South Korea). The Hawaiian pizza was inspired by Chinese sweet and sour flavors.\n\nApart from the host country, the dishes developed in overseas Chinese cuisines are heavily dependent on the cuisines derived from the origin of the Chinese immigrants. In Korean Chinese cuisine, the dishes derive primarily from Shandong cuisine while Filipino Chinese cuisine is strongly influenced by Fujian cuisine. The large population having Chinese ancestors in the United States operates many restaurants, has developed distinctive dishes (such as chop suey) based originally on Cantonese cuisine, while those are not popular among Chinese-American people.Yong Chen, Chop Suey, USA: The Story of Chinese Food in America (2014)\n\nAccording to the report released by China's largest on-demand service platform in 2018, there are over 600,000 Chinese restaurants overseas. The report also pointed out that hotpot is the most popular food in the foreign market. Sichuan cuisine and some Chinese snacks and fast food followed in second and third place, respectively.\n\nDining etiquette\n\nGreetings\nAs a guest at a meal, we should greet the host and other guests after arriving at the banquet. \n\nSeating\nThe Chinese dining etiquette has that youths should not sit at the table before the elders. If the guest of honor or most senior member is not seated, other people are not allowed to be seated.\n\nEating\nYouths should not start eating before the elders start eating. When eating with a bowl, one should not hold it with its bottom part, because it resembles the act of begging. Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food. When someone taking a break from eating at the table, they should not put the chopstick into the rice vertically, because it resembles the Chinese traditional funeral tribute, which involves putting chopstick inside a bowl of rice vertically. It is considered inappropriate to use knives on the dining table. Besides, do not wave your chopsticks around in the air too much or play with them. When you pick up food, you should first take it from the plate in front of you. It is not polite to stare at a plate. Focus on food and your companions. Watching TV, using mobile phones or doing other activities while eating is considered a bad habit. If an older person puts food in your bowl, you should thank them.\n\nRelation to Chinese art\nChinese dishes stress the three main points of appearance, smell, and taste. A really well-cooked Chinese food would need to achieve all three of them. Also, there is teaching of food carving  in Chinese culture, typically using vegetables as materials to carve the sculpture for animals and spiritual beings.\n\nRelation to Chinese philosophy\nIn Chinese philosophy, food is frequently used as the message that the author is trying to convey. A Chinese philosophy I Ching says, \u201cGentlemen use eating as a way to attain happiness. They should be aware of what they say, and refrain from eating too much.\" \n\nRelation to Chinese religion\nIn Chinese folk religion, ancestor veneration is conducted by offering food to ancestors and Chinese festivals involve the consumption and preparation of specific foods which have symbolic meanings attached to them. Specific religions in China have their own cuisines such as the Taoist diet, Buddhist cuisine and Chinese Islamic Cuisine. The Kaifeng Jews in Henan province once had their own Chinese Jewish cuisine but the community has largely died out in the modern era and not much is known about the specifics of their cuisine but they did influence foods eaten in their region and some of their dishes remain.\n\nSee also\n\n A Bite of China by CCTV\n The eight major traditions of Chinese cuisine\n Shandong cuisine\n Sichuan cuisine\n Cantonese cuisine\n Fujian cuisine\n Jiangsu cuisine\n Zhejiang cuisine\n Hunan cuisine\n Anhui cuisine\n Other traditions in Chinese cuisine\n Beijing cuisine\n Chinese imperial cuisine\n Guizhou cuisine\n Henan cuisine\n Huaiyang cuisine\n Hubei cuisine\n Jiangxi cuisine\n Shaanxi cuisine\n Shanghai cuisine\n Shanxi cuisine\n Teochew cuisine\n List of Chinese bakery products\n List of Chinese desserts\n List of Chinese dishes\n List of Chinese sauces\n List of Chinese soups\n Chinese regional cuisine\n Chinese food therapy\n History of Chinese cuisine\n Customs and etiquette in Chinese dining\n Chinese cooking techniques\n Chinese Cuisine Training Institute\n List of restaurants in China\n Pizza in China\n\nReferences\n\n Further reading \n History\n \n \n David R.

It was during the Ming dynasty of China that the wok became popularly used for stir frying.\n\nIn Indonesia, the wok-like pan is known as a penggorengan or wajan. In Malaysia, it is called a kuali (small wok) or kawah (big wok). In the Philippines, the wok is known as kawali, while bigger pans used for festivals and gatherings are known as kawa. In India, a similar pan is called karahi. In Japan, the wok is called a chao. In South India, the Chinese wok became a part of South Indian cooking, where it is called the cheena chatti.\n\nMost woks range from 12 to 18 inches or more in diameter. Woks of 14 inches (suitable for a family of 3 or 4) are the most common, but home woks can be found as small as 10 inches and as large as 24 inches.\n\nCarbon steel is currently the most widely used material for woks, being relatively inexpensive compared with other materials, relatively light in weight, providing quick heat conduction, and having reasonable durability.\n\nTwo types of cast iron woks can be found in the market. Chinese-made cast iron woks are very thin (1/8 inch), weighing only a little more than a carbon steel wok of similar size, while cast iron woks typically produced in the West tend to be much thicker (1/4 inch), and very heavy."}, {"question": "What is the process called that prevents foods from sticking and removes metallic tastes and odors from a wok?", "answer": "Question: What is the process

"The two main styles of handles for woks are loop handles and stick handles.", "rationale": "The two main styles of handles for woks mentioned in the document are loop handles and stick handles.\n\nLoop handles are mounted on opposite sides of the wok and are typical in southern China. They are the most common handle type for woks of all types and materials, usually made of bare metal. Cooks can hold the wok to toss the food in cooking by holding a loop handle with a thick towel, though some woks have spool-shaped wooden or plastic covers over the metal of the handle. Loop handles typically come in pairs on the wok and are riveted, welded, or extended from the wok basin.\n\nStick handles are long, made of steel, and are usually welded or riveted to the wok basin, or are an actual direct extension of the metal of the basin. Stick handles are popular in northern China, where food in the wok is frequently turned with a tossing motion of the arm and wrist when stir-frying food. The classic stick handle is made of hollow hammered steel, but other materials may be used, including wood or plastic-covered hand grips. Larger-diameter woks with stick-type handles frequently incorporate a \"helper\" handle consisting of a loop on the opposite side of the wok, which aids in handling."}], []], [[{"question": "What are the main differences between saut\u00e9ing and frying?", "answer": "Frying involves cooking food in a larger amount of fat, while saut\u00e9ing uses a thin layer of fat and the food is cooked by \"tossing in the pan\".

This method is distinct from pan frying and deep frying, which do not utilize a pressure cooker and have different processes for cooking the chicken."}], "crossdoc": [{"question": "Which of the frying techniques mentioned in the document is also used in the preparation of a common Japanese dish?", "answer": "Pan frying is one of the three main techniques for frying chicken mentioned in the document and it is also used in the preparation of a common Japanese dish, specifically Yakisoba which is a type of stir-fried noodle dish. The three main techniques for frying chicken are: Pan frying (or shallow frying), Deep frying, and Broasting.

Both dishes utilize frying as a key culinary technique. This reflects potential cultural influences as the shared use of frying in both cuisines suggests a connection in culinary practices. While the direct influence on Yakisoba is not specified, the emphasis on sensory aspects such as appearance, smell, and taste in Chinese culinary principles, which may have influenced Japanese cuisine, can also be seen in the preparation of Korean fried chicken, where the chicken is fried twice for a crunchier, less greasy skin and is seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt to enhance its taste."}]}, {"indoc": [], "crossdoc": [{"question": "How do Korean fried chicken and Japanese yakitori differ in terms of preparation and serving?", "answer": "Korean fried chicken, known as 'chikin', is prepared by frying the chicken twice for a crunchier, less greasy skin and is seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt. It is often served with pickled radishes and beer. On the other hand, Japanese yakitori is prepared by grilling chicken skewers, typically over charcoal, and is often seasoned with salt or a sweet soy-based sauce. It is commonly served as a snack or as part of a meal with other dishes."}, {"question": "How do the preparation methods and serving styles of Korean fried chicken and Japanese yakitori compare to the variations of Tonkatsu, including alternatives to pork?", "answer": "Korean fried chicken and Japanese yakitori have distinct preparation methods and serving styles. Korean fried chicken, or 'chikin', is prepared by frying the chicken twice for a crunchier, less greasy skin and is seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt. It is often served with pickled radishes and beer. Japanese yakitori, on the other hand, is prepared by grilling chicken skewers, typically over charcoal, and is often seasoned with salt or a sweet soy-based sauce. It is commonly served as a snack or as part of a meal with other dishes. In comparison, Tonkatsu is a Japanese dish consisting of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. Variations of Tonkatsu include Katsu sando (sandwich), Katsu curry, Katsudon, Miso katsu (Nagoya specialty), Konnyaku (calorie-conscious alternative), Chicken katsu, Menchi-katsu (minced meat), Hamu katsu (ham), and Gy\u016b katsu (beef, popular in Kansai region). These variations show that Tonkatsu can be made with different types of meat and served in various ways, unlike the frying or grilling methods used in Korean fried chicken and Japanese yakitori."}, {"question": "How do the preparation methods of Korean fried chicken, Japanese yakitori, and Tonkatsu compare, and what are the primary ingredients used in the production of miso?", "answer": "The preparation methods of Korean fried chicken, Japanese yakitori, and Tonkatsu are quite distinct. Korean fried chicken, or 'chikin', is prepared by frying the chicken twice for a crunchier, less greasy skin and is seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt. Japanese yakitori is prepared by grilling chicken skewers, typically over charcoal, and is often seasoned with salt or a sweet soy-based sauce. Tonkatsu, on the other hand, is a Japanese dish consisting of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. The primary ingredients used in the production of miso include soybeans, salt, k\u014dji (the fungus Aspergillus oryzae), and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. The production of miso began in Japan during the Neolithic era (J\u014dmon period, 14,000\u2013300 BC), and its origin can be traced back to China during the third century BC or earlier, introduced to Japan along with Buddhism in the sixth century AD."}]}, {"indoc": [], "crossdoc": [{"question": "Which Tonkatsu variation is categorized as a deep-fried dish and what are other examples of deep-fried Japanese dishes mentioned?", "answer": "The Tonkatsu variation that is categorized as a deep-fried dish is Tonkatsu itself, which is a deep-fried breaded pork cutlet.

More than 80% of Japan's total annual production of miso goes into making miso soup, showcasing its integral role in Japanese cuisine. On the other hand, Tonkatsu, while being a popular dish, does not consume a comparable percentage of pork in its total annual production, as it is just one of many dishes that use pork as an ingredient."}, {"question": "Considering the high percentage of its key ingredient used in total annual production, how does the primary ingredient of Miso Soup, miso, compare in terms of its production and usage in Japanese cuisine?", "answer": "Miso, a primary ingredient in Miso Soup, is produced using soybeans, salt, k\u014dji, and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. Its production in Japan dates back to the Neolithic era (J\u014dmon period, 14,000\u2013300 BC), with origins traced to China during the third century BC or earlier, introduced to Japan in the sixth century AD. Miso is a staple in Japanese cuisine, with over 80% of Japan's total annual production of miso going into making miso soup, highlighting its integral role.

After retiring from competition swimming, he became a lawyer in California and, after becoming a naturalized American, he was appointed a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Central District of California by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, and presided over the trial of the Los Angeles Police Department officers charged with assaulting Rodney King.\n\nSwimming career\nDavies entered and won both breaststroke events at the 1946 New South Wales Championships held at Manly. He began to train under Forbes Carlile in 1947 and won the 220yd breaststroke at the Australian Championships, as well as helping New South Wales to win the 3x110yd medley relay. He repeated these victories at the 1948 Australian Championships, earning selection for the 1948 Summer Olympics in London at the age of 19. In the lead up to the Games, he won two races in London. Davies came second in his heat and fourth in his semifinal with an Australian record 2m 44.8s to qualify for the final of the 200m breaststroke.

Without scholarship support available for swimmers in that era, he pursued a political science degree, while supporting himself by washing dishes and working at the International Student Centre. Mann also altered Davies's style, changing from the even-paced racing of Carlile to an early-attack oriented style of swimming. Davies managed a second placing at the 200yd breaststroke at the NCAA Championships in 1948, but failed to place in 1949 and 1950. In 1951 he won the 200m breaststroke at the AAU National Outdoor Championships and in 1952 won the 200yd breaststroke short course at the NCAA Championships setting a new world record of 2:21.9 and the 200m Breaststroke AAU National Indoor Championship. The Australian Olympic Federation granted him an exemption from the Australian Championships and selected him for the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He trained with fellow team member John Marshall at Yale University under coach Robert Kiphuth while the rest of the Australian team trained in Townsville.\n\nDavies arrived in Helsinki as the favourite after setting the 200 yard breaststroke (short course) world record earlier in the year, but after a poor time trial a week before the Games, he was forced to restrict his training to under a kilometre per day and sleep for 20 hours daily. Davies was not the fastest qualifier in the heats, but broke the Olympic record set by Jerry Holan in the prelims.  Swimming in his even paced style, Davies trailed by more than 2 seconds at the 100m mark, but overhauled his rivals, pipping the United States' Bowen Stassforth by 0.3s to reset his new Olympic record and tie the existing world record (long course) time of 2m 34.4s set by Herbert Klein of Germany who was third. Davies, Stassforth, and Klein were the only three swimmers to better 2:35 in history in the 200 m breaststroke (long course) prior to the bifurcation of the stroke in 1953.\n\nLegal career \nDavies retired from swimming and returned to the University of Michigan to study law for two years before doing an exchange year at the University of Sydney and then transferring to the University of California Los Angeles, where he completed his degree in 1959. He married and settled in Pasadena, California, taking United States citizenship and passing the bar examinations to become an attorney. From 1960 to 1971 Davies was associated with, and then became a partner of Hagenbaugh, Murphy & Davies where he specialized in litigation and tried many cases in the areas of personal injury, products liability, medical malpractice, construction and insurance coverage. Davies joined the Beverly Hills, California firm of Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman in 1971, becoming a partner in 1972, practicing litigation. He represented major motion picture studios and entertainment companies.\n\nOn 22 April 1986, Davies was nominated by U.S. president Ronald Reagan to a seat on the United States District Court for the Central District of California vacated by Cynthia Holcomb Hall. Davies was confirmed by the United States Senate on 6 June 1986, and received his commission on 9 June 1986. Davies presided over the trial of a group of Los Angeles Police Department officers charged in relation to the Rodney King incident in 1992. In 1993 he was named District Judge of The Year by the Criminal Justice Section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and he received the Congressional Certificate of Special Recognition for Exemplary Performance. He also received the Daniel O'Connell Award from the Irish American Bar Association. He retired from the bench on 18 July 1998.\n\nHonours\nDavies was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1984, and the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1992.  He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000.\n\nSee also\n List of members of the International Swimming Hall of Fame\n List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)\n World record progression 200 metres breaststroke\n\nRecord Notes\nThe world record for the 200 meter breaststroke prior to the bifurcation of the butterfly breaststroke into separate strokes in 1953 could be accomplished in either short or long course pools. FINA recognized only one world record for the 200 meter breaststroke.  The 1952 US Olympic Book lists the 200 meter breaststroke world record as belonging to Herbert Klein with a time of 2:27.3 who swam it in a short course pool. If records were measured as they are today in long and short course pools, Davies tied Herbert Klein's long course world record of 2:34.4 for the 200 meter breaststroke set on August 13, 1950 in G\u00f6ppingen, Germany at their 1952 Olympic final.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n Wallechinsky, David and Jaime Loucky (2008). \"Swimming (Men): 200-Meter Breaststroke\".

He won five Commonwealth Games gold medals and claimed a total of nine individual and six relay titles at the Australian Championships, before retiring at the age of 21 due to financial pressures.\n\nAfter showing promise at an early age, O'Brien was sent to Sydney to train under renowned coach Forbes Carlile and his breaststroke assistant Terry Gathercole. He competed in his first national championships in 1962 at the age of 15, winning the 220\u00a0yard breaststroke to gain selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, where he won both the 110 and  breaststroke and the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0110\u00a0yd medley relay.\n\nHe won both breaststroke events at the 1963 Australian Championships, repeating the feat for the next three years. In 1964, O'Brien went to the Tokyo Olympics and came from third at the 150\u00a0m mark to win the gold medal. He added a bronze in the medley relay. O'Brien successfully defended both his breaststroke titles at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica before retiring to support his family. Swimming officials persuaded him to make a comeback for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, as Australia did not have a breaststroker, and after a crash diet, he finished sixth in the 100\u00a0m event but failed to reach the final in the 200\u00a0m event. He then retired and went into the television industry.\n\nEarly years \nO'Brien grew up in the rural town of Wellington, 360 kilometres (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke\u2014the breaststroke\u2014and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.\n\nAfter winning all the breaststroke events at the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole. Carlile was regarded as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6\u00a0kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program while he was in the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.\n\nInternational debut \nIn 1962, O'Brien gained selection for the Australian swimming team at the age of 15 when he won the 220\u00a0yard (yd) breaststroke at his first Australian Championships in the time of 2\u00a0minutes (min) 41.8\u00a0seconds (s). He added a second gold as part of the New South Wales team that won the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m medley relay in a time of 4\u00a0min 18.3\u00a0s. His performances gained him selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth. At his first international competition, he won gold in each of his three events. He competed in the  and  breaststroke, defeating fellow Australian William Burton in both events with times of 1\u00a0min 11.4s and 2\u00a0min 38.1\u00a0s, respectively. He then completed his campaign with a victory in the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0110\u00a0yd medley relay, combining with Julian Carroll, Kevin Berry and David Dickson to complete the race in a time of 4\u00a0min 12.4\u00a0s.\n\nIn 1963, O'Brien captured the breaststroke double at the Australian Championships, setting personal bests in both events, and was a member of the New South Wales team that won the medley relay. His performances earned him selection for an overseas tour to Europe with the Australian team, competing in the Soviet Union, Germany and England before visiting Japan and Hong Kong. O'Brien defended his breaststroke double at the 1964 Australian Championships, lowering his times to 1\u00a0min 8.1\u00a0s and 2\u00a0min 32.6\u00a0s for the 100\u00a0metres (m) and 200\u00a0m breaststroke respectively. He capped off his campaign as well as a third consecutive medley relay triumph for New South Wales. Within a year, he had reduced his times in the two events by more than 3%. As O'Brien was widely regarded as Australia's best breaststroker, he was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. O'Brien joined the rest of the team for the national camp before the Olympics in Ayr in northern Queensland, where he trained under head coach Don Talbot. O'Brien described Talbot as a \"slavedriver\", but felt that the experience was invaluable.\n\nOlympic gold \nArriving in Tokyo, O'Brien was nominated in the 200\u00a0m event and the medley relay; the 100\u00a0m event was yet to be included in the Olympic program. The favourites for the 200\u00a0m breaststroke were Chet Jastremski of the United States\u2014the world record holder\u2014and Georgy Prokopenko of the Soviet Union. Gathercole had modelled O'Brien's technique on that of Jastremski, attempting to refine and smoothen it. Years after O'Brien retired, Harry Gallagher said that \"Ian O'Brien has an almost faultless style and is a great example for Australian youngsters to copy\". O'Brien was known for the strength that his torso generated, and his powerful kicks; sports science experiments showed that his vertical jump was especially strong. O'Brien was also known for his efficient start off the block. He often gained a lead of approximately a metre from his dive and underwater glide at the start, and was able to complete 50\u00a0m in 31.0\u00a0s.\n\nDuring the final training sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which were held in front of opposition swimmers in an attempt to intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2\u00a0min 33\u00a0s, which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2.0\u00a0s. He posted a time of 2\u00a0min 31.4\u00a0s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8\u00a0s, an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark, and by the end of the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2\u00a0min 28.7\u00a0s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4\u00a0s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0\u00a0s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half.\n\nIn the final, Jastremski attacked from the outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50\u00a0m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win the gold medal in a new world record time of 2\u00a0min 27.8\u00a0s, a margin of 0.4\u00a0s, with Jastremski a further 1.4\u00a0s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win.\n\nThe Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. It turned out to be a close call for the Australians, as they finished fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2\u00a0s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' backstroke leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4\u00a0s behind the American leaders. O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1\u00a0min 7.8\u00a0s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7\u00a0s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4\u00a0min 2.3\u00a0s, missing the silver by 0.7\u00a0s.\n\nLater career \nO'Brien completed a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, but in a year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1\u00a0min 11.1\u00a0s and 2\u00a0min 38.6\u00a0s respectively. He completed a fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1\u00a0min 11.8\u00a0s and 2\u00a0min 41.6\u00a0s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, but it was still enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16\u00a0kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1\u00a0min 8.2\u00a0s and 2\u00a0min 29.3\u00a0s respectively. His winning run in the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.\n\nIn 1967, O'Brien skipped the Australian Championships because he had no sponsorship and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200\u00a0m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7\u00a0kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.\n\nAt the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, O'Brien placed second in his heat of the 200\u00a0m breaststroke in a time of 2\u00a0min 36.8\u00a0s, which placed him 13th. He was eliminated, having been 2.9\u00a0s slower than the last-placed qualifier for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9\u00a0s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100\u00a0m event, winning his heat in a time of 1\u00a0min 8.9\u00a0s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1\u00a0min 9.0\u00a0s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1\u00a0min 8.6\u00a0s.\n\nO'Brien narrowly missed a medal in the 4\u00a0\u00d7 \u00a0100\u00a0m medley relay. Along with Michael Wenden, Robert Cusack and Karl Byrom, the Australian quartet won their heat and entered the final as the equal fifth fastest qualifier. In the final, O'Brien swam his leg in 1\u00a0min 8.6\u00a0s, which was only the fifth fastest breaststroke leg. Australia were fourth at the end of each leg, except O'Brien's, when they were third. Australia eventually missed out on the bronze by 0.1\u00a0s to the Soviet Union. O'Brien admitted that his training had been insufficient for Olympic standards, noting that \"I needed to put on another thousand kilometres in training\". O'Brien also rued the absence of Talbot to motivate him to work, and had a further accident at the Olympic Village when his fingers were slammed by a closing window. Under competition regulations, he was not allowed to bind his hand during competition.\n\nOut of the pool \nAt age 21, O'Brien retired after the 1968 Olympics, so he could concentrate solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming career had caused substantial financial stress for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, so that he could support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held for more than ten years. He then worked for Channel Ten for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal.\n\nSee also\n List of members of the International Swimming Hall of Fame\n List of Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming (men)\n List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)\n World record progression 200 metres breaststroke\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:1947 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Australian male swimmers\nCategory:Olympic swimmers of Australia\nCategory:Olympic gold medalists in swimming\nCategory:Olympic gold medalists for Australia\nCategory:Olympic bronze medalists for Australia\nCategory:Swimmers at the 1964 Summer Olympics\nCategory:Swimmers at the 1968 Summer Olympics\nCategory:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics\nCategory:Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming\nCategory:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia\nCategory:Swimmers at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games\nCategory:Swimmers at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games\nCategory:Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal\nCategory:Sport Australia Hall of Fame inductees\nCategory:People from the Central Tablelands\n"}, {"id": "BkksM6DxK7kqUrQG3bIh", "content": "Shane O'Brien (rower)\n\nShane Joseph O'Brien (born 27 September 1960) is a former New Zealand rower who won an Olympic gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, USA.\n\nEarly life\nO'Brien was born in 1960 in Auckland, New Zealand. He received his secondary school education at Mount Albert Grammar School from 1974 to 1978, where he was prefect and captain of the rowing team.\n\nRowing career\nAlong with Les O'Connell, Conrad Robertson and Keith Trask he won gold in the coxless four at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. O'Brien also competed at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, Scotland, winning a silver medal in the coxless four and a bronze medal in the eights. At the 1985 World Rowing Championships at Hazewinkel in Belgium, he came fourth with the coxless four.  He is listed as New Zealand Olympian number 482. His three medals were stolen in a burglary in 2006.\n\nTeaching career\nO'Brien is a trained teacher. In the late 1980s, he went back to his old school to teach there. He also taught at an intermediate school in Auckland. He moved to England in the early 1990s where he worked as a teacher and coached rowing at Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith. He worked closely with the Latymer Upper School boatman at the time, Coyne T. Mullen. In 1999, he went on to Shiplake College, on the River Thames south of Henley-on-Thames; he was the deputy headmaster there. One of the Shiplake College rowers who had trained under him, Will Satch, went to win Olympic bronze at the 2012 Summer Olympics (coxless pair) and gold four years later (eight). Before he left Shiplake College, a new coxless four boat purchased by the school was named for O'Brien. He became headmaster of Jumeirah English Speaking School (Dubai, UAE) in mid-2011, and director in September of 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1960 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:People educated at Mount Albert Grammar School\nCategory:New Zealand male rowers\nCategory:Olympic rowers of New Zealand\nCategory:Olympic gold medalists for New Zealand in rowing\nCategory:Rowers at the 1984 Summer Olympics\nCategory:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for New Zealand\nCategory:Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for New Zealand\nCategory:Commonwealth Games competitors for New Zealand\nCategory:Rowers at the 1986 Commonwealth Games\nCategory:Schoolteachers from Oxfordshire\nCategory:New Zealand schoolteachers\nCategory:British people of New Zealand descent\nCategory:Rowing coaches\nCategory:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics\nCategory:Commonwealth Games medallists in rowing\nCategory:Emirati schoolteachers\n"}, {"id": "BkksLcDxK2ljekRube_X", "content": "Les O'Connell\n\nLeslie James O'Connell (born 23 May 1958) is a retired New Zealand rower who won an Olympic gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, USA.\n\nEarly life\nO'Connell was born in 1958 in Timaru, New Zealand. He grew up in the town and started a carpentry apprenticeship in 1974. Since 1990, he has lived in Christchurch.\n\nRowing career\nO'Connell learned to row on Saltwater Creek in Timaru, and in Timaru Harbour. In 1978, he was New Zealand champion with Chris Booker in the double sculls for the Timaru Rowing Club. He moved to Christchurch in 1990 so that he could train with the Avon Rowing Club, at the time one of the three main rowing clubs in the country.\n\nAt the 1982 World Rowing Championships at Rotsee, Switzerland, he won a gold medal with the New Zealand eight seated in the bow. At the end of that year, the 1982 rowing eight crew was named sportsman of the year. O'Connell then changed to a coxed four and at the 1983 World Rowing Championships in Duisburg, Germany, he won gold with Conrad Robertson, Greg Johnston, Keith Trask, and Brett Hollister as cox. He qualified for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and was put in a coxless four (the coxed four is not included as an Olympic event), and teamed with Shane O'Brien, Conrad Robertson, and Keith Trask. Helped by the absence of the Eastern Bloc countries including the favourites from the Soviet Union and East Germany, the New Zealand coxless four won an unexpected gold medal.

He set several national records and qualified for the Olympic Games, and served as a race official and administrator for more than 40 years, holding office at club level for more than 30 years, later holding several national roles and then co-founding the Irish Veteran Cycling Association.\n\nLife\n\nCycling career\n\nEarly cycling career\nO'Connell began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers cycling club in 1948, participating in road races and time trials, most notably from 1948 to 1956; he was later made a life member of the club.  \n\nIn 1952, he was selected to ride for Ireland in the World Championships in Luxembourg, and in international races on the Isle of Man alongside Shay Eliott.  He also won an Olympic trial race that year, qualifying to attend, but Ireland was excluded from the Olympics in cycling at that time.  In 1953, he won the national Road Race Championships, just ahead of Shay Eliott and then Jim McQuaid.  He also secured several place-to-place Irish records, such as Dublin-Wexford in 3 hours and 58 minutes, and Dublin-Derry in 7:09.\n\nClub and national office\nHaving held various club offices, he was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as Road Racing Secretary of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF), for 1972-1974.  The Dublin Wheelers were very active in national cycling governance in the 1960s and 1970s, with, in 1972, for example, Liam King as general secretary and Joe Doyle as treasurer, in addition to O'Connell as road racing secretary, Paddy McInerney time trial secretary, and Steve Lawless organiser of the Tour of Ireland, while Willie Marks also competed for a national committee general position.  Along with Ian Gallahar as P.R.O. for several years, all of these served many years in national sport organisation.\n\nO'Connell was a representative of the ICF to the global cycling conference of 1974, and seated on the Olympic Council of Ireland. He later participated in the Tripartite Committee, which worked between the various cycling bodies on the island of Ireland, and on the disciplinary and sporting committees of the fully unified Federation of Irish Cycling.  O'Connell also worked on the organising committee of the Tour of Ireland from 1968 to 1980. \n\nO'Connell qualified as a masseur and accompanied Irish cycling teams abroad in that capacity.  He also worked as a team mechanic, and team manager, and with the Falcon team in the Nissan International Classic in Ireland over two years.\n\nVeterans\nIn 1966, O'Connell co-founded the Irish Veteran Cyclists Association (IVCA), and cycled competitively at veteran level until 1988, and casually until the 2010s.  In 1989, he became general secretary of the IVCA, serving for more than a decade, and later being elected as Honorary President for life.\n\nPersonal life\nO'Connell was a staff member and later a manager at Frawley's department store on Thomas Street in Dublin's Liberties.  He married Elizabeth (Lily) O'Connell, whose sister Rita married the brother of his friend and fellow Dublin Wheelers committee member, Joe Doyle. The O'Connells had four children, and two of them, and his wife, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, survived him.  He lived most of his life in the Manor Estate between Terenure, Kimmage and Greenhills.  He became ill in 2013, died 26 January 2016; his funeral was at Greenhills and he was buried at Palmerstown Cemetery.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1928 births\nCategory:2016 deaths\nCategory:Sportspeople from Dublin (city)\nCategory:Irish male cyclists\nCategory:Irish cycling administrators\nCategory:Olympic Federation of Ireland officials\n"}, {"id": "BkksMrbxK7EgBYMF9xpC", "content": "Joe Doyle (cyclist)\n\nJoseph Doyle, born 1933, Dublin, Ireland, was an Irish road racing cyclist and cycle sport administrator, holding office at club, county and national federation level for more than 20 years, including 14 years as national treasurer.\n\nLife\n\nCycling career\nAfter a childhood leg illness, Doyle began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers Cycling Club in the 1950s; he was joined by his brother Noel, and later another brother, Frank. He participated in road races and time trials and, after winning the handicap event of the Wheelers Winter Cycling League in 1954, was selected to ride in the Isle of Man international annual races in 1955, then one of the main external race destinations from Ireland as well as races in Belgium and France. \n\nHe also held various club and Dublin County Board offices, including a spell as Chairman of the Dublin Wheelers, then one of the biggest and most active clubs in the country, and others as Dublin County Treasurer and Dublin County Club Secretary.\n\nNational roles\nIn 1962 Doyle was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as national treasurer of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the CR\u00c9, for the 1963 season.  By November 1963 he reported greatly improved finances.  Having been involved over the years in discussions about unification of Irish cycling, he was reported to have resigned in 1966 in protest at aspects of the process, but this report was later refuted.  After the planned dissolution of the CR\u00c9 in October 1967, he was deeply involved in the transition to the new national organization, the Irish Cycling Federation, that December, and was elected its first treasurer, continuing in office until 1976.  \n\nThe Dublin Wheelers were very active in national cycling governance in the 1960s and 1970s, with, in 1971-1972 for example, Liam King as general secretary and Doyle as treasurer, as well as Donal O'Connell as road racing secretary, Paddy McInerney time trial secretary, and Steve Lawless organiser of the Tour of Ireland, while Willie Marks also competed for a national committee general position.  Along with Ian Gallahar as P.R.O., all of these served many years in national sport organisation.\n\nIn 1973, Doyle promoted changes to the governance of the ICF, whose committee had agreed that a smaller executive structure would be more efficient.  Doyle stepped down as treasurer in November 1976, then served one year as assistant to the new holder of the office. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Doyle continued to officiate at races, working closely with fellow Dublin Wheelers Willie Marks and Donal O'Connell. After a break, he cycled into his 60s.\n\nPersonal life\nComing from the Liberties and Synge Street CBS, and later qualifying as a carpenter and then a builder, Doyle later also worked as a site foreman, and a Clerk of Works at the Office of Public Works, overseeing maintenance and projects at a range of State buildings and national monuments around Dublin.  Married to Margaret, and with three children, he lived most of his life in parts of Raheny. He died 4 April 2012 at a nursing home in Howth after a prolonged illness, and was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. One of his brothers, Noel, married the sister of his fellow Dublin Wheelers and national executive committee member, Donal O'Connell.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1933 births\nCategory:People educated at Synge Street CBS\nCategory:Sportspeople from Dublin (city)\nCategory:People associated with Raheny\nCategory:Irish male cyclists\nCategory:Irish cycling administrators\nCategory:2012 deaths\n"}, {"id": "BkksMOvxK6EtqojOFLw9", "content": "Steve Lawless\n\nSteve Lawless (born 1937 or 1938) from Dublin, Ireland, was an Irish road racing cyclist and later cycling administrator, holding office at club and national level in Irish cycling over more than 15 years, including spells as co-director of the Tour of Ireland stage race and as national president, and helping to drive the unification of the sport on the island of Ireland.\n\nCycling career\nLawless began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers cycling club in the 1950s, participating in road races and time trials.\n\nNational roles\nHaving held various club offices, he was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as General Secretary of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the CR\u00c9, in 1960, at the young age of 22.

Irish rider Se\u00e1n Kelly recorded the most wins, four.\n\nThe first Tour of Ireland race debuted in 1953 and ran until 1957. It was revived in 1965 and ran until 1985. In 1985 the 5-day Nissan International Classic took over as the Tour of Ireland. This lasted for 8 years until 1992. The race returned 15 years later, in 2007, as the Tour of Ireland and was part of the UCI Europe Tour.  The organisers confirmed on 1 June 2010 that the 2010 race would not take place due to a financial shortfall, and as of 2019, there is no further news of a revival.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins, 1950s\nThe original Tour of Ireland was a cycling stage race run in Ireland between 1953 and 1984, and organised by the internationally-recognised governing body, Cumann Rotha\u00edochta na h\u00c9ireann (CRE), later reformed as the Federation of Irish Cyclists. In 1953 the Irish Government initiated An T\u00f3stal, a cultural festival, and asked all Irish sporting bodies to participate. As part of this the CRE ran a four-day Tour of Ireland. With sponsorship from An Tostal, Aspro and Hercules cycles, the event was known as the Tostal Tour and was a big success throughout most of the country, although it was said to have \"had a hard time in the NCA heartlands of Kerry\" There is limited information about the race available on the internet and no book has been written about the event. The inaugural edition was a 4-day race won by Brian Haskell from John Perks and A Walker. Seamus Elliot who later won a stage and wore the yellow jersey in the 1963 Tour de France finished tenth overall. Briton Brian Robinson who also won a stage in the Tour de France finished fifth in this first edition. According to Alf Buttler, an amateur cyclist during and after the second world war the leader\u2019s jersey was purple and the race continued but as a seven-day race the following year, 1954, beginning on Thursday 29 April. The 1954 race was covered by J B Wadley and photographer Bill Lovelace for The Bicycle magazine and a full report appeared in the 5 May issue. Bernard Pusey (England A team) won from Seamus Elliott (Ireland A team) and Tony Hoar (England B team). According to Bray Wheelers, an Irish cycling club from Bray, Wicklow, the event continued until 1957.\n\nFirst revival, 1960s\nThe tour was revived in 1965. During the seventies the race was known as the Raleigh Dunlop Tour of Ireland. The event continued to 1984. Winners during this period include Doug Dailey (1971, 1973), Liam Horner (1972), a double Olympian, Tony Lally (1974), a 1980 Olympian and the youngest ever winner at age 20, Pat McQuaid (1975, 1976; later UCI President), Angel Arroyo (1977), runner up in 1983 Tour de France, John Shortt (1978) and Ron Hayman (1979) who was followed home by Phil Anderson, Stephen Roche and Robert Miller in 2nd, 3rd and 4th.\n\nNissan International Classic, 1985-1992\nThe Nissan International Classic was then organised from 1985 until 1992 which it appears took over from the Tour of Ireland. The Nissan Classic was referred to as the Tour of Ireland by the famous Irish cyclist Stephen Roche during the 1987 edition.\n\nThe race was organised by the Events Group and was sponsored by Nissan; Alan Rushton was the race controller and future President of the UCI, Pat McQuaid, was the race director. It was a hugely successful event that captured the spirit and imagination of the race going public who stood at the side of the road in vast numbers. The event occurred during the golden age of Irish cycling when Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche were at the height of their success in European cycling. Kelly dominated the Irish event by winning four  of the eight races. Roche won two stages in the first edition and finished second in the 1987 edition while wearing the rainbow jersey of world champion but never won the event. The event used the most famous 'wall' in Ireland \u2013 the steep ascent of St. Patricks Hill in Cork city as the finale of a stage in almost every edition of the event. Other areas that the event regularly visited included Kelly's hometown of Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary, O'Connell Street in Limerick and Eyre Square in Galway. The race used to finish on O'Connell Street in Dublin after doing many laps of a circuit in the city centre.\n\nThird revival, 2007-2009\nAfter a break of fifteen years, it was announced that the event was returning to Ireland in early 2007 and sponsored by F\u00e1ilte Ireland and called the Tour of Ireland. This event was organised by the Events Group and Shadetree Sports and the route of the race took in many of the same areas that the Nissan Classic covered. Just like the 1987 edition of the Nissan Classic, the Tour of Ireland started from Kilkenny Castle. The first stage used St. Patricks Hill in Cork city in its finale. The five-day stage race concluded on 26 August and was won by Stijn Vandenbergh of Belgium. Lance Armstrong & Mark Cavendish took part in the 2009 edition, which was shortened to a 3-day event due to the economic downturn. \n\nThe organisers confirmed on 1 June 2010 that the 2010 race would not take place due to a financial shortfall, but that they hoped it will return in 2011. It was due to take place from 18 August to 22 August 2010.\n\nPast winners\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official Website of the Tour of Ireland\n Overview of the Nissan Classic and articles on each edition 1985\u20131992\n Tour of Ireland at cyclingarchives.com\n\nCategory:UCI Europe Tour races\n*\nCategory:Recurring sporting events established in 1953\nCategory:1953 establishments in Ireland\n"}, {"id": "BkksMZzxK6Etr6O4y1bZ", "content": "Seamus Elliott\n\nSeamus 'Shay' Elliott (4 June 1934 \u2013 4 May 1971) was an Irish road bicycle racer, Ireland's first major international rider, with a record comparable only to Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche. He was the first Irish person to ride the Tour de France, first to win a stage, and first to wear the yellow jersey, and first English speaker to win stages in all the Grand Tours.\n\nAfter a strong amateur period, primarily with the Dublin Wheelers, Elliott was the first Irish cyclist to make a mark as a professional rider in continental Europe. A late-starting but naturally talented rider, he spent most of his pro career riding as a domestique for team leaders such as Jacques Anquetil, and Anquetil's deputy Jean Stablinski.  He came 2nd (to Stablinski) in the 1962 World Road Championship at Sal\u00f2, Italy.\n\nAside from being the first English-speaker to lead the Tour de France, wearing the yellow jersey for three days,, Elliott was first English-speaker to lead the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, in which he came third in 1962 and was the only English-speaker to win the Omloop \"Het Volk\" semi-classic until 2014 when Ian Stannard won the race.  He died in unclear circumstances at the age of 36.\n\nLife\n\nEarly life\nElliott was from the working class area of Crumlin in Dublin, the eldest son of James Elliott, a motobike mechanic, and Ellen, always known as Nell. He played Gaelic football and hurling and didn't learn to ride a bicycle until he was 14. He used it to ride to the town of Naas.\n\nAmateur career\n\nHe joined a small cycling club, St Brendan's, attached to St Brendan's Catholic Church, Coolock, when he was 16 and took part in races of about 20 miles that the church organised around the city streets. He came second in his first race, riding a \"scrap\" bike with a single fixed wheel that led his pedals to bang the road on corners. The winner had a specialised racing bike.\n\nElliott joined the Southern Road Club when he was 17 and, on a racing bike, won the Grand Prix of Ireland run over 50\u00a0km in the Phoenix Park. The club broke up soon afterwards and Elliott joined the Dublin Wheelers, one of the most active clubs at that time, in March 1952. That summer he won the Mannin Veg, a race over one lap of the TT motorcycling circuit on the Isle of Man. He also won the Dublin-Galway-Dublin two-day race, winning the race back to Dublin in a sprint.\n\nIn 1953 he rode the Manx International, over three laps of the TT circuit, for the Ireland \"B\" team. He fell on the tricky turn at Governor's Bridge, shortly before the finish, but came fourth. He won the 1953 Irish amateur road championship. \n\nHis King of the Mountains placing in the Tour of Ireland in 1954 earned him a trip to the Simplex training camp in Monte Carlo the following spring.\n\nJock Wadley said of him in Sporting Cyclist:I can not remember all the items in Shay's luggage, of course. But I can hardly forget that one whole compartment in the chest of drawers was devoted to provisions which Shay had brought from Ireland, the chief stock being 2lb [1kg] of tea and 2lb of chocolate creams. I was invited to eat as many of the chocolates as I liked, because his aunt who worked in the place where they were made would soon be sending more.\n\nHe said that Elliott was one of several riders asked to strip for examination by the soigneur Raymond Le Bert, who normally worked for Louison Bobet. Wadley wrote:It would be wrong to say that the company laughed when Shay stood there in his underpants, but there were certainly some smiles because in contrast to his lithe, clean-limbed predecessors at the examination, Shay looked a short, fat boy. Le Bert, however, did not smile. Immediately he exclaimed: 'Ah ha, now this is really rock. He is a real flahute. (Flahute is a favourite French way of describing the old-type tough Flemish roadman.)\n\nElliott did not return permanently to Ireland at the end of the training camp in early 1955. He had just finished six years as an apprentice sheet-metal worker and he and his family in Old County Road in Crumlin, had decided that he had mastered panel-beating and would have a trade to return to if his efforts to become a professional cyclist failed. He contacted a former French professional, Francis P\u00e9lissier, for advice. P\u00e9lissier told Elliott to compete in as many races as possible, at least three or four a week \u2013 possibly in France, but not in Ireland, a cycling backwater. Elliott planned to move to Ghent in Belgium, where he could race several times a week and, as an amateur, win money denied to him in Ireland. At the training camp, however, he met the journalist and race organiser Jean Leulliot, who told him he would burn himself out in round-the-houses racing and urged him to move to Paris.\n\nLeulliot remembered how Elliott had won the Tourmalet stage of the 1954 Route de France, which Leulliot's paper, Route et Piste, organised. Leulliot asked in his paper for someone to accommodate Elliott in the capital and added \"The Irishman is soaked with class and has a great future before him.\" The appeal was answered by Paul Wiegant of the Athletic Club Boulogne-Billancourt (ACBB) in Paris, France's top amateur team. Elliott won five one-day amateur classics in 1955 and set the world 10\u00a0km amateur record on the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver in Paris. He was the first foreigner to be ranked top amateur in France.\n\nElliott turned professional for the 1956 season.\n\nProfessional career\n\nElliott signed as a professional for the Helyett-F\u00e9lix Potin team (Helyett was a bicycle manufacturere). He won his first race, the GP d'Echo Alger in Algeria, outsprinting Andr\u00e9 Darrigade. He also won the GP Catox and the GP Isbergues. In his first major race of 1957, the Omloop \"Het Volk\" in Belgium, he made a race-long break with Englishman Brian Robinson. The break was caught near the finish but Elliott's form was noted. He won the Circuit de la Vienne. He became a team-mate of Jacques Anquetil and Jean Stablinski, staying with the team under different sponsors for much of his career.\n\nIn 1959 he won Omloop \"Het Volk\", the first foreigner to do so. He attacked on the Mur de Grammont with 30\u00a0km to ride and dropped all his rivals except Fred De Bruyne, the Belgian hope. The pair raced together to the finish where Elliott won easily. \n\nThat season Elliott rode the Tour de France, then run for national teams, in a mixed team that included the Englishman, Brian Robinson. Robinson rode above his level across the Massif Central and next day paid the price; he trailed far behind the field. William Fotheringham wrote:In hot weather, these are some of the toughest roads in France, constantly rising and falling. Elliott remained with Robinson, chivvying him, pacing him, pouring water on his head as the Tour's doctor, Pierre Dumas administered glucose tablets. It was the kind of heroic spectacle the Tour reporters loved. Robinson en perdition ran the next day's headline in L'\u00c9quipe, which described Elliott's efforts as \"attentions de m\u00e8re poule\" \u2013 the solicitousness of a mother hen. Both finished outside the day's race elimination time limit, and expected to be sent home. However, the team's manager, Sauveur Ducazeaux, insisted the judges apply a rule that no rider in the first ten could be eliminated. Robinson had started the day ninth: it was Elliott who was sent home. \"The mother hen was cooked; the chick avoided the pot\", Fotheringham said.  Robinson always regretted the outcome, and when he won the next stage, told journalists that he did it for Elliott.\n\nIn 1960, Elliott became the first English-speaking rider to take the pink jersey in the Giro d'Italia. In 1962, he came third in the 1962 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, coming second in the points classification, and winning the fourth stage; he led the race for nine days. \n\nIn the 1962 world road championship at Sal\u00f2 in Italy, he got into the winning break with Stablinski. Stablinski was a team-mate in the professional peloton and a friend but a rival in the championship, where riders rode in national teams. However, Elliott and Stablinski worked to wear down the other break members. When Stablinski attacked, Elliott refused to chase and the Frenchman won alone. Elliott eventually broke away to take the silver medal. Elliott admitted he had sacrificed his chance for Stablinski's benefit.  \"Team loyalty was a theme that ran throughout Elliott's career,\" noted the editor of Cycling Martin Ayres. Elliott said: \"I'm not supposed to say that I helped Jean, but he's the best friend I've got in cycling and godfather to my son, Pascal. So I couldn't very well go after him, could I?\"\n\nHis best result was in the 1963 Tour de France. He won by 33 seconds, enough to give him the yellow jersey of leadership. He held it for three days. Another 20 years passed before another Irishman, Sean Kelly, led the Tour.  This achievement also made him the first English-speaker to lead the three great European tours, of Italy, Spain and France.\n\nElliott spent his career as a domestique, a rider who sacrifices his chances for his leader, but with the right to sprint for wins. He made a career from appearance contracts and start money, riding criteriums in Belgium \u2013 the races that Leulliot said would burn him out \u2013 and races in Britain, including a meeting at the velodrome at Herne Hill in London where the star attraction was the Italian, Fausto Coppi. \n\nElliott also rode and won the professional race on the Isle of Man, the Manx Premier.\n\nControversies\nElliott was contracted to ride London-Holyhead in 1965, at 275 miles the longest single-day race in the world not to use pacers. Tom Simpson won, beating Elliott and a domestic professional, Albert Hitchen. Controversy started the moment that Cycling printed a picture of the sprint. Elliott had his hands tugging his brakes before the line. The magazine suggested he was braking to avoid the crowd further down the road, but many thought it a fix. Another rider in the race, Pete Ryalls, said in Procycling in 2008:\nThe fix was for Barry Hoban to win. Barry was touch and go whether he'd get another contract because he'd done sweet FA all season. And it all went wrong because he didn't have the form anyway and it's a bloody long way if you don't have the legs. And the thing that messed it up was that going across Anglesey a big tall lanky guy called Peter Gordon. He pushed off and caused all sorts of consternation and the only people who could get across to him were Simpson and the guys he'd brought across with him, and Hitchen... so presumably they sorted it out between them afterwards, but that was the fix: that Hoban should win. I know for certain that it was.\nElliott, braking to stop Hitchen behind him, so Simpson could win, was riding in Simpson's pay. Simpson offered Elliott \u00a31,000 to help him win the world championship in 1963. Elliott refused, speculation being that he had been offered more by someone else.\n\nElliott later wrote a newspaper article suggesting that he made more money by selling races than winning them.\n\nDecline\nElliott's career started to fade from the mid-1960s. He moved in 1966 from Anquetil's team to the rival Mercier-BP, sponsored by a bicycle company and an oil company and led by Anquetil's rival, Raymond Poulidor. Elliott planned for retirement by opening a hotel in Loctudy in Brittany.  He had no prior experience in the hospitality trade and that project took so much of his time that he could ride only local races. After promising Mercier-BP that he would make amends in the world championship, the chain came off his bicycle and he finished 15th.\n\nThings grew worse. His marriage to Marguerite, failed. The hotel, too, failed and Elliott lost all his money. \n\nTo try to restore his situation, he sold a story to the British tabloid newspaper, The People, telling of drug-taking and bribery. The article went into few details but was enough for him to be snubbed by other professionals. The same had happened to Simpson when he sold his story to the same paper but while Simpson recovered despite reprimands from his agent, criticism in the cycling press and a threat of dismissal by his team, Elliott's career never regained momentum. British cycling journalist Jock Wadley, who had shared a room with Elliott at the Simplex training camp, said: \"I knew times were hard for him but nobody knew just how hard until he had to do that.\"\n\nLater years\nElliott returned to Dublin in 1967 and set up a metal-working business in Prince's Street in the city centre, with his father. Marguerite remained in France, with his only son, Pascal. Friends helped him to build a small apartment above the business.\n\nElliott tried a racing comeback in Britain in 1970 with the Falcon Cycles team and came 21st in his first race, London-Holyhead. Domestic professional racing was not as attractive or rewarding as continental. Combining cycling with a full-time job meant he struggled.\n\nCycling in Ireland\nDespite problems, he continued to ride - he was active with the Bray Wheelers club based south of Dublin, train juniors and formulate plans for Irish cycling.  He did once run for vice-president of the Irish Cycling Federation but lost to Paddy McQuaid.\n\nDeath\nOn 21 April 1971, his father died. Two weeks after his father's death, on 4 May 1971, Shay Elliott was found dead in the living quarters above the family business premises, at the age of just 36. The cause of death was a shotgun wound, rupturing his heart and liver, from a gun about whose unreliable fittings friends had warned him. The coroner recorded an \"open verdict\" and three competing theories circulated about the cause of death: that it was indeed a gun accident, that he committed suicide, and that he was killed by a Breton crime syndicate to whom he owed money from his failed hotel business (he had worried about people \"hanging round\" near the premises in previous weeks). He was laid to rest alongside his father at St Mochonog's Church, Kilmacanogue, County Wicklow, with his wife Marguerite, parents and brother in attendance.  His son Pascal died in a motorcycle accident on 13 November 1978 at the age of 16, and was buried in France.\n\nLegacy\nThe Shay Elliott Memorial Road Race is run every year in Ireland in his honour. The race was previously (since 1959) known as the Route de Chill Mhantain (Circuit of Wicklow). It became the Shay Elliott Trophy in the late sixties, then the Shay Elliott Memorial after his death in 1971.\n\nA monument to Elliott, erected by friends and Bray Cycling Club, stands at the top of the climb from Drumgoff Bridge, Glenmalure heading towards Laragh, County Wicklow, where the race's KOH mountain prime is situated.\n\nDelegates from the Tour de France visited Elliott's grave when the Tour came to Ireland in 1998.\n\nCoverage\nIn 2009 a documentary film, Cycle of Betrayal, about Shay Elliott, was shown in Ireland (first on Setanta Ireland) and the UK.  A book, a section of a book, and many articles, have also been written about Elliott.\n\nMajor results\n\n1953\n Irish amateur road champion\n1954\n Irish National Road Race Championships (CN)\n1955\n Irish National Road Race Championships (CN)\n1956\n 1st Grand Prix d'Isbergues\n\n1957\n 1st Semaine Bretonne\n 1st Circuit de la Vienne\n 3rd Paris\u2013Bourges\n 1st points classification Paris\u2013Nice\n\n1958\n 1st GP Sigrand\n 2nd GP de Nice\n 2nd Tour de Picardie\n 1st points classification and 2 stages Four Days of Dunkirk\n\n1959\n 1st Omloop \"Het Volk\"\n 1st GP de Denain\n 1st GP de Nice\n 1st Manx Trophy\n\n1960\n 1st Troph\u00e9e Peugeot (Rennes-Brest)\n 1st Stage 3a GP Ciclomotoristico\n 2nd Circuit de l'Indre\n 2nd Nice-Genoa\n 1st Stage 18 Giro d'Italia (Grand Tour)\n\n1961\n 1st stage 2 Four Days of Dunkirk\n\n1962\n 2nd World Championship Elite Road Race\n 2nd Circuit de la Vienne\n 2nd Paris\u2013Camembert\n 2nd GP du Vercors\n 3rd overall, Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a (Grand Tour)\n 1st Stage 4\n 2nd overall on points classification\n held the leaders gold jersey for 9 stages\n 3rd Circuit Mandel-Lys-Escaut\n 3rd GP d'Orchies\n\n1963\n 1st GP de Vayrac\n 2nd Paris\u2013Camembert\n 2nd Tour de l'Oise\n 1st Stage 13 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a (Grand Tour)\n 1st Stage 3 Tour de France (Grand Tour)\n held leaders yellow jersey for 3 stages\n\n1964\n1st Manx Trophy\n\n1965\n 1st Tour de l'Oise (1st stage 1)\n 1st GP de Saint-Rapha\u00ebl\n 1st GP d'Esp\u00e9raza\n 1st GP d'Orchies\n 2nd London-Holyhead\n\n1966\n1st GP du Tr\u00e9gor\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSeamus Elliott's palmares, memoire-du-cyclisme.net ]\n\nCategory:1934 births\nCategory:1971 deaths\nCategory:Irish male cyclists\nCategory:Irish Giro d\u2019Italia stage winners\nCategory:Giro d'Italia cyclists\nCategory:Irish Tour de France stage winners\nCategory:Tour de France cyclists\nCategory:Irish expatriates in France\nCategory:Sportspeople from Dublin (city)\nCategory:Sheet metal workers\nCategory:Deaths by firearm in the Republic of Ireland\n"}, {"id": "BkksLBLxK6nvWIJWmzuL", "content": "Stephen Roche\n\nStephen Roche (; born 28 November 1959) is an Irish former professional road racing cyclist.

All of these wins still stand, despite Roche having been accused by an Italian judge of taking EPO in the later part of his career.\n\nEarly life and amateur career\nOn completion of his apprenticeship as a machinist in a Dublin dairy and following a successful amateur career in Ireland with the \"Orwell Wheelers\" club coached by Noel O'Neill of Dundrum (which included winning the Irish Junior Championship in 1977 and the R\u00e1s Tailteann in 1979), Roche joined the Athletic Club de Boulogne-Billancourt amateur team in Paris to prepare for the 1980 Olympic games in Moscow. Soon after his arrival Roche won the amateur Paris\u2013Roubaix, escaping with Dirk Demol and sprinting to victory on the track at Roubaix. Roche was told by his directeur sportif that if he did not win he \"would be sent home to Ireland that day\".\n\nHe also finished on the podium at the early-season Paris\u2013Ezy road race and finished 14th overall in the Sealink International stage race which was won by Bob Downs. However, a knee injury caused by a poorly fitted shoe plate led to a disappointing ride in Moscow, where he finished 45th. However, on return to France, August to October saw Roche win 19 races. That led to a contract with the Peugeot professional cycling team for 1981.\n\nProfessional career\nRoche scored his first professional victory by beating Bernard Hinault in the Tour of Corsica. Less than a month later he won Paris\u2013Nice (where he became the first, and still the only, new pro to win Paris\u2013Nice) despite illness following the descent from Mont Ventoux and finished his debut season with victories in the Tour de Corse, Circuit d'Indre-et-Loire and \u00c9toile des Espoirs races with a second place behind Hinault in the Grand Prix des Nations. In total, his debut yielded 10 victories.\n\nIn 1982 his best performance was second in the Amstel Gold Race behind Jan Raas, but his rise continued in 1983 with victories in the Tour de Romandie, Grand Prix de Wallonie, \u00c9toile des Espoirs and Paris\u2013Bourges. In the 1983 Tour de France, Roche finished 13th and he finished the 1983 season with a bronze medal in the world cycling championship at Alterheim in Zurich.\n\nIn 1984, riding for La Redoute following contractual wrangles with Peugeot (the settlement of which led Roche to sport Peugeot shorts for two years before winning a court action against V\u00e9lo Club de Paris Peugeot) he repeated his Tour de Romandie win, won Nice-Alassio, Subida a Arrate and was second in Paris\u2013Nice. He finished 25th in that year's Tour de France.\n\nIn 1985, Roche won the Crit\u00e9rium International, the Route du Sud and came second in Paris\u2013Nice and third in Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge. In the 1985 Tour de France Roche won stage 18 to the Aubisque and finished on the podium in 3rd position, 4 minutes and 29 seconds behind winner Bernard Hinault.\n\nChronic knee injury\nIn 1986 at a six-day event with UK professional Tony Doyle at Paris-Bercy, Roche crashed at speed and damaged his right knee. This destroyed his 1986 season at new team  with little to show other than second in a stage of the Giro. Roche finished the 1986 Tour de France 48th, 1h 32m behind Greg LeMond, a Tour that Roche described as like \"entering a dark tunnel\" of pain.\n\nThe injury and then associated back problems recurred throughout his career (for example in the 1989 Tour Roche abandoned after banging the problem knee on his handlebars) and a series of operations appeared to only address direct or consequential symptoms of the core injury. Later non-surgical intervention under Dr.Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt in Munich made some difference but the injury required constant care.\n\nBy the end of his career Roche was unable to compete at his best because of back problem which led to a loss of power in the left leg. In retirement he described riding the 1993 Tour de France \"just for fun\". He finished 13th, riding for Claudio Chiappucci).\n\n1987 Triple Crown\n\nIn 1987, Roche had a tremendous season. In the spring, he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, taking a third victory in the Tour de Romandie and fourth place plus a stage win in Paris\u2013Nice. He also finished second in Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge, the closest he got to winning a professional 'Monument' Classic. He blamed it on tactical naivet\u00e9 and \"riding like an amateur\".\n\nIn the Giro d'Italia, Roche took three stage wins (including a team win with  in the team time trial) en route to overall victory and became the first Giro victor from outside mainland Europe. Roche's stage wins that year in the Giro were stage 1b, the  time trial downhill on the Poggio into San Remo and stage 22, a  individual time trial into St. Vincent. Despite his stage wins, the race is remembered for the stage from Lido di Jesolo to Sappada, where Roche, contravening team orders, broke away alone early and despite being caught late in the race, had the strength to go with the counterattack and take the pink jersey from his teammate Roberto Visentini, who had been previously leading the classification. His behaviour in the stage gained him the tifosi's hatred. It was said the only member of his team that Roche could rely on not to ride against him was his domestique Eddy Schepers, although Roche recruited Panasonic riders and old ACBB teammates Robert Millar and Australian Phil Anderson to protect him with Schepers on the Marmolada climb (a day known as the \"Marmolada Massacre\").\n\nRoche finished the Giro exhausted but favourite for the Tour de France. Following Bernard Hinault's retirement, Laurent Fignon's choppy form and with Greg LeMond injured following an accidental shooting while hunting, the 1987 Tour was open. It was also one of the most mountainous since the war, with 25 stages. Roche won the  individual time trial stage 10 to Futuroscope and came second on stage 19.\n\nOn the next stage, crossing the Galibier and Madeleine and finishing at La Plagne, Roche attacked early, was away for several hours but was caught on the last climb. His nearest rival Pedro Delgado then attacked. Despite being almost one-and-a-half minutes in arrears midway up the last climb, Roche pulled the deficit back to 4 seconds. Roche collapsed and lost consciousness and was given oxygen. When asked when revived if he was okay, he replied \"Oui, mais pas de femme toute de suite\" (\"yes, but I am not ready for a woman straight away\").\n\nThe yellow jersey (worn by the leader of the general classification) changed hands several times with Charly Mottet, Roche, Jean Fran\u00e7ois Bernard and Delgado all wearing it before Roche used the final  time trial to overturn a half-minute gap and win the Tour by 40 seconds, which was at the time the second-narrowest margin (in 1968 Jan Janssen had beaten Herman Van Springel by 38 seconds; two years after Roche's victory, Greg LeMond beat Laurent Fignon by 8 seconds). Roche became only the fifth cyclist in history to win the Tour and the Giro in the same year. He was also the only Irishman to win the Tour de France. Irish Taoiseach Charles Haughey joined Roche on the podium on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nLater that year, with victory at the World road race championship in Villach in Austria, Roche became only the second to win the Triple Crown of Cycling. Roche arrived with insufficient training although he worked during the 23-lap,  undulating terrain for his teammate Sean Kelly and escaped in the race-winning break only while covering for his countryman. With Moreno Argentin in the following group, Kelly did not chase and as the break slowed and jostling for position began for a sprint, Roche attacked  from the finish and crossed the line with metres to spare.\n\nVictory in the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International competition was assured.\n\nRoche was given the freedom of Dublin in late September 1987. Several days later the 1987 edition of the Nissan Classic began and Roche rode strongly to finish second behind Kelly.\n\nPost-1987 career\n\nAt the close of 1987, Roche moved to Fagor MBK, bringing English riders Sean Yates and Malcolm Elliot, 1984 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Robert Millar and domestique Eddy Schepers. The team was criticised for containing too many English speakers.\n\nThe 1988 season began badly with a recurrence of the knee injury and Roche began a gradual decline. In 1989 he again took second in Paris\u2013Nice (making four second places) and the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme. Roche finished the 1989 Giro d'Italia ninth behind Laurent Fignon. During the 1989 Tour de France, Roche withdrew due to his knee.\n\nThere were problems with his team in and he changed again. In 1990, racing for Histor Sigma, he won the Four Days of Dunkirk and 1991 riding for Roger De Vlaeminck's TonTon Tapis brought victories in the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme and Crit\u00e9rium International. In the 1991 Tour de France, Roche missed the start for his team's Team time trial and was forced to withdraw due to controversially missing the time cut.\n\nIn the Grand Tours, he was ninth in the 1989 Giro, and won a stage of the 1992 Tour de France in appalling conditions into La Bourboule (again racing for  but now in support of Claudio Chiappucci) and en route to a final ninth place. Riding the last edition of the Nissan Classic Tour of Ireland, Roche was in many breaks but finished fifth. A year later, he was again ninth in the 1993 Giro d'Italia and 13th in the 1993 Tour de France.\n\nRoche retired at the end of an anonymous 1993 which yielded a single win, in the post-Tour de France criterium at Chateau Chinon.\n\nAlleged doping\n\nIn May 1990, Paul Kimmage \u2013 a former professional and teammate of Roche at Fagor, as well as a fellow Dubliner \u2013 published an account of life in the peloton. His book Rough Ride exposed drug use apparently endemic in the peloton but spoke in fawning terms about Roche. Despite this, publication resulted in a threat of litigation from Roche.\n\nIt was reported in the Rome newspaper, La Repubblica, in January 2000 that Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara involved with administering erythropoietin (EPO) to riders on the Carrera team with which Roche had some of his best years, had provided riders including Roche with EPO. Roche denied the allegations. This was further reported in The Irish Times several days later, Roche again denying EPO. In March 2000 the Italian judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the investigation into sports doctors including Conconi. This official judicial investigation unequivocally found that Roche was administered EPO in 1993, his last year in the peloton.\nFiles from part of the investigation allegedly detail a number of aliases for Roche including Rocchi, Rossi, Rocca, Roncati, Righi and Rossini. In 2004 Judge Oliva again alleged that Roche had taken EPO during 1993 but due to the statute of limitations, neither Roche nor his teammates at Carrera would be prosecuted.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoche lives in Antibes on the C\u00f4te d'Azur. Roche remained involved in the sport by founding cycling camps in Majorca, by taking part in race organisations and working as a commentator on cycling events for Eurosport.\n\nHe has four children with his former wife Lydia; the couple divorced in 2004. One son, Nicolas Roche, is now a professional with Team Sunweb, and was the 2009 and 2016 Irish National Road Race Champion.\n\nStephen's brother Lawrence Roche was also a professional cyclist who completed his only Tour de France in 1991. They were teammates on the Ton Ton Tapis team.\n\nRoche's nephew Dan Martin is also a professional cyclist with UAE Emirates, and was the 2008 Irish National Road Race Champion.\n\nRoche completed the 2008 ING New York Marathon in a time of 4:21:09.\n\nAdvertisements\nRoche featured in a well-known Irish television advert for Galtee cheese in 1987, shortly after winning the Tour De France.\n\nCareer achievements\n\nMajor results\n\nMain Source\n\nAmateur \n1978\n 1st  Road race, National Junior Road Championships\n 1st Isle of Man -

The route consisted of twenty-three laps totaling to a length of . Irishman Stephen Roche won the race, while Italian Moreno Argentin and Spaniard Juan Fern\u00e1ndez finished second and third, respectively. By winning the race, Roche also completed the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year.\n\nRace route\n\nThe race route contained 23 laps of , equaling a total  of racing in all. Each lap featured two climbs that were  and , respectively. The race started at 10:30 AM local time. Sportswriters found the course to be suited for sprinters, believing that the race would likely result in a sprint finish.\n\nParticipants and race favorites\n\nThe race began with 168 riders from 26 different countries, of which 71 finished. The starting field featured the previous year's winner Moreno Argentin, who was seen as the race favorite by many journalists and the Austrian bookmakers. A writer for Amigoe believed the Dutch and Italian teams to be the best teams competing in the race. Cees Olsthoorn of Het vr\u0133e volk believed that Steven Rooks and Teun van Vliet were the Dutch riders with the best chances of winning. Avui writer F. Recuero named Guido Bontempi, Teun van Vliet, and Eric Vanderaerden as other riders capable of winning the race. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano believed an Italian rider would win the race, specifically Argentin or Bontempi, but stated the Dutch riders were a team to \"fear.\"\n\nRace summary\n\nAfter speculation of the start being delayed due to severe thunderstorms, the race began on time, during heavy rain. Roche was part of a 14-man breakaway, principally working to help teammate Sean Kelly get to a final sprint. However, attacks by the Dutch team in the final 5km led Roche to bridge over to the escapees leaving Kelly behind. Roche won the sprint to the line after launching his attack with  remaining.\n\nResult\n\nAftermath\n\nRoche became the first ever Irishman to win the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships. In addition, he became the second rider \u2013 after Eddy Merckx in 1974 \u2013 to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling, which consists of winning two Grand Tour races and the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships in a calendar year. Upon finishing the race, Roche stated that was like \"a fairy tale\" and that he \"came to Austria to help [Sean] Kelly\" going on to mention how the course did not suit him and he was not well prepared for the race.\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nCategory:UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race\nUCI Road World Championships - Men's road race\nCategory:1987 UCI Road World Championships\n"}], "intra_doc_qas": [[[]], [[]], [[{"question": " Parker?", "answer": "Mary Dorothea \"Dorrie\" Parker, born on 10 August 1928, died on 24 December 1993.

{"aggregated_docs": [{"id": "BkksMKbxK3xheLmWg72W", "content": "Edna Krabappel\n\nEdna Krabappel-Flanders (also Krabappel)  is a fictional character from the animated American sitcom The Simpsons, who was voiced by Marcia Wallace from 1990 until her death in October 2013. She was a 4th grade teacher, who taught Bart Simpson's class at Springfield Elementary School. In the twenty-third season, she married Ned Flanders, the widower of Maude Flanders, helping raise Rod and Todd Flanders until her death.\n\nEdna is the only character that Wallace voiced on a regular basis. Following Wallace's death, the show's producers announced their intention to retire the character. Edna Krabappel's final speaking role was the epilogue of the 25th season episode \"The Man Who Grew Too Much\".\n\nProfile\nEdna Krabappel holds a Master's from Bryn Mawr College. She is a surly, grumpy and jaded caricature of the American public school system. In \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\", it is revealed that she was once a very optimistic woman who genuinely wanted to help people in need. It would seem that after years of frustration thanks to the school, and Bart Simpson in particular, this wore away.\n\nThere is some inconsistency about Edna's origins. She is said to have come to Springfield to begin teaching in \"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\". However, in a case of retconning, she can be seen in \"Springfield Up\" as a student running through the background at Springfield High School while a young Chief Wiggum is filmed carrying out his duties as a hall monitor as part of the documentary featured in that episode.\n\nEdna smokes heavily, including during school hours. In the episode \"Grade School Confidential\", she and Principal Skinner have a romance after they are invited to Martin Prince's party. They are witnessed kissing in Martin's playhouse by Bart. Principal Skinner then sends Bart to relay a message to Edna in front of his classmates who laugh at him, making him furious. He then shows them what they are doing and tells them not to tell anyone about their relationship, especially Superintendent Chalmers. Unknown to Bart they lose their jobs when Superintendent Chalmers finds out about their affair via Chief Wiggum and they lock themselves in the school with Bart until they are reinstated. They apologize to Bart for embarrassing him. After returning to their jobs, they resume their romance in a janitorial closet. In \"Bart Gets a 'Z'\", she is fired from teaching when she becomes drunk after drinking coffee that was spiked with alcohol by Bart. She later decides to open a muffin store. She is later rehired when the substitute teacher gets drunk. In \"Moms I'd Like to Forget\", she fights a fifth grade teacher, Mike, who talks badly about her students; this leads to a massive teacher brawl. In \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", she is suspended from teaching for slapping Bart and is placed in the Teacher Holding Facility. When Bart attempts to free her, she falls off a ladder but is saved by Ned Flanders.\n\nLove life\nA recurring theme is Edna's desire for a romantic partner. She is divorced; in \"Separate Vocations\", she implies that her husband left her for their marriage counselor with whom he had an affair. In early episodes, she is shown as very sexually aggressive and promiscuous: in \"Flaming Moe's\", she is shown with her arms around two sailors in the parody of the famous Cheers theme, and tries to pick up Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson, even after learning he is married and is Bart's father. In \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\", while the children are watching an unseen explicit scene in Fuzzy Bunny's Guide to You-Know-What, a sex ed film, she says to the children in disgust, \"She's faking it\". In the same episode, Nelson Muntz asks why she does not live with \"Mr. Krabappel\", she tells him that her ex-husband \"chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole\". In \"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\", she has a \"hot encounter\" with a local Japanese sushi chef in the backseat of her car. The episode \"Bart the Lover\" was the first episode to give Edna a central role, and also to expand her character and personality. Edna appears to be desired by many men (and in one case even women, when Patty Bouvier once had a sexual fantasy with Edna), as seen in Sideshow Bob's outrage (in \"Brother from Another Series\") wherein his romantic date with her is ruined by a spying Bart: \"You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel!\"\n\nAnother theme is her relationship with the school principal, Seymour Skinner. In the episode \"Grade School Confidential\", she develops a secret romance with Skinner, a relationship that almost leads to marriage. In the episode \"Special Edna\", Skinner proposes to Edna, to which she agrees. However, in the episode \"My Big Fat Geek Wedding\", Edna leaves Skinner at the altar after realizing that he doesn't want to marry her. Since then, Edna's attitudes to Skinner have vacillated between passion and disdain in various episodes. In The Simpsons Movie, she can be seen at the Green Day concert on top of Seymour's shoulders wearing a T-shirt saying \"Not my boyfriend\" with an arrow pointing down at Skinner.\n\nIn season 17 (\"The Seemingly Never-Ending Story\"), a flashback showed that Edna was in a serious relationship with Moe Szyslak when she first moved to Springfield, before meeting Skinner or even becoming a teacher. She was about to elope with him, but then changed her mind when she met Bart Simpson, a student she believed needed help. Consequently, Moe breaks up with her. At the end of the episode, Moe and Edna are a couple once again, much to Skinner's jealousy when he catches them making out on school property. In \"Regarding Margie\", she and Principal Skinner are seen making love on a golf course. Then he climbs off and she says, \"Birthday is over, Seymour\", and lights up a cigarette.\n\nEdna is in a relationship with Ned Flanders. During the 22nd episode of the 22nd season, \"The Ned-Liest Catch\", Ned and Edna began dating (Though the two have dated previously in the episode \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\"). The fate of the couple was left to a fan vote, to be revealed during the 23rd season opener. When \"The Falcon and the D'ohman\" debuted, it revealed that the fans voted in favor of the relationship. At the close of the episode, a disclaimer appeared on screen which stated \u2013 \"What our fans have joined together, let no writer rip asunder\". It is also revealed in \"The Ned-Liest Catch\" that she has \"dated\" in addition to Skinner, Moe Szyslak, Lenny, Carl, Comic Book Guy, Joey Kramer, Krusty the Clown, Cletus Spuckler, and several others.\n\nIt is revealed in the episode \"Ned 'n Edna's Blend\" that Edna and Ned married in secret (although she continues to use her first married name, Krabappel, as a teacher), and the town throws them a proper reception. In the episode \"Left Behind\", Ned took a teaching job as a way to honor Edna's memory after she dies. In the 30th season episode, \"My Way or the Highway to Heaven\", Edna is seen in heaven next to George Washington while Maude Flanders is seen next to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nCharacter\n\nKrabappel's name was chosen by early Simpsons writers Wallace Wolodarsky and Jay Kogen as a play on the fruit \"crabapple\" and as a reference to the teacher Miss Crabtree from the 1930s Our Gang shorts. Also, there was an initial joke of no one mispronouncing the character's last name as \"Crabapple\" until Milhouse uses it in a later episode, stunning the other children. The real Seymour Skinner also mispronounced her name as \"Crabapple\". In one episode, Homer is horrified to learn that no one has corrected him for calling her \"Crandall\". Like many characters, Ms. Krabappel has a memorable catchphrase, used often in the series: her derisive laugh (\"HA!\").\n\nRetirement\nMarcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013; according to her son, the cause of death was related to pneumonia. Staff on The Simpsons had reportedly been aware of her illness. Showrunner Al Jean said, \"I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace.\" He also announced that the show would retire the character. The series first acknowledged Wallace's passing in the episode \"Four Regrettings and a Funeral\", in which the chalkboard gag in the opening sequence was changed to read a single \"We'll really miss you Mrs. K\". The episode \"The Man Who Grew Too Much\" later showed Ned Flanders wearing a black armband and mourning Edna, whose portrait joined that of Maude, Ned's first wife. The episode was the 13th of the 25th season, a nod to the day and year of Wallace's death. In \"Moho House\" she appears as a ghost with Maude when Marge looks at everyone enjoying their spouses.\n\nCultural impact and reception\nMarcia Wallace won an Emmy Award in 1992 for voicing Krabappel in the third season-episode \"Bart the Lover\". IGN called \"Special Edna\" the best episode of the fourteenth season of the show. Tilda Swinton modeled her hairdo in the film Burn After Reading on Krabappel's.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Edna Krabappel on IMDb\n\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1990\nCategory:Fictional schoolteachers\nCategory:Fictional smokers\nCategory:Female characters in television\nCategory:Animated human characters\nCategory:Female characters in animation\n\nde:Figuren aus Die Simpsons#Edna Krabappel\n"}, {"id": "BkksLLLxK7DgjI4TceLu", "content": "Principal Skinner\n\nPrincipal W. Seymour Skinner (born Armin Tamzarian) is a recurring fictional character in the animated sitcom The Simpsons, who is voiced by Harry Shearer. He is the principal of Springfield Elementary School, which he struggles to control, and is constantly engaged in a battle against its inadequate resources, apathetic and bitter teachers, and often rowdy and unenthusiastic students, Bart Simpson being a standout example.\n\nA strict disciplinarian, Skinner has an uptight, militaristic attitude that stems from his years in the United States Army as a Green Beret, which included service in the Vietnam War, where he was captured and held as a prisoner of war. He is quick to take orders from his superiors; chiefly his mother, Agnes, and Superintendent Chalmers.\n\nRole in The Simpsons\nOut of genuine concern for the quality of education of his students, most of Skinner's actions revolve around ensuring the school has adequate funding. His constant, desperate, and usually ineffective attempts at maintaining discipline are an effort to receive good reviews in the frequent inspections of his very strict boss, Superintendent Chalmers\u2014who makes no effort to hide his disapproval of Skinner. These inspections usually turn awry due to Bart Simpson's elaborate pranks\u2014which play-off Skinner's desperation for order. Over the years of pranks and inspections, though, Skinner has developed a love-hate relationship with Bart; when Skinner was fired and replaced by Ned Flanders, Bart found pranks less meaningful, due to Flanders' lax approach to discipline, while Skinner missed his constant battles with Bart. The two bonded during this time and Bart made an effort to get Skinner reinstated in the school.\n\nOne of Skinner's defining traits is that he had served as a sergeant in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, where he was captured by the Viet Cong at the Battle of Khe Sanh and spent 18 months as a prisoner of war. Seeing his entire platoon devoured by an elephant was one of the many things that led to the development of his posttraumatic stress disorder. He is also quite bitter about the treatment he and other Vietnam veterans received upon returning from the war. Skinner is a highly skilled combatant, particularly hand-to-hand, and demonstrates his abilities in several episodes. Skinner often seems weak-willed and easily suppressed, but often will use his military command experience gained in the Vietnam War to get real respect and discipline. When he and the students were snowed-in at the school, he treated them like his squad to control the chaos temporarily, before they mutinied.\n\nAlthough Skinner likes to maintain the image of a strict disciplinarian, he is often weak-willed and nervous and has a very unhealthy dependence on his mother, who constantly torments him and nicknames him \"Spanky\". Aside from a short-lived relationship with Patty Bouvier, most of Skinner's love life has focused on Edna Krabappel. He and Edna kiss in Martin's playhouse after they are invited to a birthday party, and they are witnessed by Bart. He loses his job along with Edna when Superintendent Chalmers is advised of their romance by Chief Wiggum, after which Skinner and Edna lock themselves in the school with Bart demanding their jobs back. After Skinner is reinstated, he and Edna dated for several more years and became engaged, but later cancelled the wedding. Edna has shown she does want to continue dating Skinner, but first wants him to commit to her\u2014namely by not letting his mother, with whom he still lives, control him anymore.\n\nThe controversial season 9 episode \"The Principal and the Pauper\" heavily altered Skinner's backstory, revealing him as an impostor. Born as Armin Tamzarian, he was a troubled orphan from Capital City, who was forced into the US Army during the Vietnam War. There, he served as a Green Beret under Sgt. Seymour Skinner, whom he came to idolize and befriend. When the sergeant was reported missing and presumed dead, Armin returned to Springfield to inform Skinner's mother, Agnes, but she deliberately mistook him for Seymour, so he assumed his identity and followed Skinner's dream of becoming a school principal. The real Seymour Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen), had been alive after all, and briefly returned to Springfield to take his rightful place as Springfield Elementary School Principal, but had proved hopelessly unpopular and the Springfielders ran him out of town on the railroad. Judge Snyder granted Tamzarian Skinner's \"name, and his past, present, future, and mother\", and decreed that no one will mention his true identity again \"under penalty of torture\" (although Lisa uses the real name in the episode \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\"). A clip from the episode was used in season eleven's \"Behind the Laughter\" as an example of the show's increasingly \"gimmicky and nonsensical plots\". The continuity of the series appears to revert to the original story of Seymour Skinner in the 2010 episode \"Boy Meets Curl\", as he is clearly shown to kick Agnes Skinner in utero, establishing him as Agnes' biological son after all. This is further declared in the Season 29 episode \"Grampy Can Ya Hear Me\" where a teenage Seymour is shown living with Agnes before going off to college.\n\nAnother part of Principal Skinner's backstory is revealed in the season 21 episode \"Pranks and Greens\", when Bart Simpson plays numerous pranks on teachers of the school. Principal Skinner reveals to Bart that there was a student who was an even better prankster than him, and Bart is very eager to find the identity of the prankster. Later, Groundskeeper Willie tells him a story: Years ago, Springfield Elementary School had a swimming pool and a swimming team, and Willie was the coach of the team. Back then, Skinner was quite laid back as a principal, but it all changed when Andy Hamilton, a student then and the aforementioned prankster, managed to fill the pool with worms and locked Skinner in the pool for the whole weekend. Monday was a teacher's holiday, so Skinner was not rescued until Tuesday morning. This experience caused him to become serious and almost merciless in his approach on rules, even going as far as to shut down the pool and demoting Willie, the swim teacher, to groundskeeper. From then on, Skinner became a very strict principal.\n\nCharacter\n\nCreation\nPrincipal Skinner first appeared in \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", which was also the first Simpsons episode to air. The first drawing of Skinner was done by Matt Groening, who based him on \"all the principals of [his] youth, rolled into one bland lump.\" Writer Jon Vitti named him after behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner. An original idea for Skinner was that he would continually mispronounce words. He does this in the series premiere \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\", but the idea was later dropped. Skinner was originally supposed to wear a toup\u00e9e, but it was dropped because the writers didn't like \"that type of joke\". In later episodes, Skinner's behavior was based on teachers that Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had in high school.\n\nDevelopment\nSuperintendent Chalmers was introduced in the episode \"Whacking Day\" as a boss for Skinner. Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, the voice of Chalmers, fell right into the characters and quite often ad-lib between them.\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\"\nIn \"The Principal and the Pauper\", it is revealed that Skinner was not who he claimed to be and was really named Armin Tamzarian. The episode was pitched and written by Ken Keeler and he was inspired by the Tichborne case of 19th century England. Producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were excited about the episode because Principal Skinner was one of their favorite characters. They \"spent a month immersed in the mind of Seymour Skinner\" to prepare that episode, and from that point forward, took every opportunity to \"tinker with [Skinner's] personality and his backstory and his homelife.\"\n\nThey intended for the episode to be \"an experiment\" and that the ending was meant to allow viewers to reset to the point before Skinner was revealed to be an impostor. The revelation that Principal Skinner was not whom the audience had long been led to believe (as well as the self-referential deus ex machina ending of the episode) was negatively received by many fans and critics, and is considered by some to be the point at which the series as a whole jumped the shark. Oakley considers \"The Principal and the Pauper\" the most controversial episode from his tenure as executive producer.\n\nIn April 2001, in an interview, Harry Shearer, the voice of Principal Skinner, recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\" \n\nThe writers themselves have since mocked the inconsistencies created by the episode; in the season 15 episode \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\", Lisa is seen writing Snowball II on a cat food dish to save money after what would be the fourth Snowball's purchase. Skinner walks by and asks \"that's really a cheat, isn't it?\" to which Lisa pointedly replies, \"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian.\" Skinner then quickly excuses himself to Lisa and walks away.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nPrincipal Skinner on IMDb\n\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Fictional adoptees\nCategory:Fictional characters from New Orleans\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1989\nCategory:Fictional characters with posttraumatic stress disorder\nCategory:Fictional impostors\nCategory:Fictional Mensans\nCategory:Fictional orphans\nCategory:Fictional principals and headteachers\nCategory:Fictional schoolteachers\nCategory:Fictional United States Army Special Forces personnel\nCategory:Fictional Vietnam War veterans\nCategory:Male characters in animation\nCategory:Male characters in television\n"}, {"id": "BkksLlnxK2ljekRubpjP", "content": "Milhouse Van Houten\n\nMilhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the animated television series The Simpsons, voiced by Pamela Hayden, and created by Matt Groening who named the character after President Richard Nixon's middle name. Later in the series, it is revealed that Milhouse's middle name is \"Mussolini.\"\nMilhouse is Bart Simpson's best friend in Mrs. Krabappel's fourth grade class at Springfield Elementary School, and is insecure, gullible, and less popular than Bart. Milhouse is often led into trouble by Bart, who takes advantage of his friend's na\u00efvet\u00e9, and he is also a regular target for school bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz. He also has a crush on Bart's sister, Lisa, which is used as a plot element in many episodes. Milhouse is one of the few residents in Springfield with visible, in fact rather thick, eyebrows.\n\nProfile\nMilhouse is of Dutch and Italian descent, based on comments and characters introduced throughout the series. He has his mother's coloring, but none of her confidence. He has his father's facial features, as well as his father's primary personality features (which include disappointment, insecurity, and generally depressed demeanor). Milhouse is constantly bullied by Nelson Muntz, Jimbo Jones, Dolph Starbeam, and Kearney Zzyzwicz, to the point that when Bart questions Milhouse by saying \"Milhouse! I thought you had a three o'clock wedgie with Nelson\", in the episode \"Little Orphan Millie\", Milhouse simply responds \"I had to reschedule\". They often inflict violence upon the geeky Milhouse, who wears thick eyeglasses, without which he cannot see.\n\nAlthough not disliked and having a moderate number of friends among other kids from school aside from Bart himself, Milhouse has made a career of getting victimized, although his overall true antagonists are the schoolyard bullies of Springfield Elementary (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney). In \"Sideshow Bob Roberts\", Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney wrapped Milhouse in bumper stickers and placed him in a shopping cart. After Jimbo claimed that \"the mummy's ready for his mystical journey!\", the bullies pushed the cart with Milhouse down a very steep hill. He is harmed frequently, and on some occasions is injured by dangerous hazards, e.g., being run over by a train, falling down a waterfall, receiving electrical shocks, having his head polished to bone, and having his teeth knocked out by a hockey puck.  As a lead character he always survives and recovers, often with no further mention of any injuries. He frequently visited a female psychiatrist until even she could not deal with his constant calling and blocked his number.\n\nOn one occasion, Bart got Milhouse placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List even though they are friends, and tried to lure Milhouse into a cactus. Milhouse is not always subservient to Bart; in \"Bart Sells His Soul\", Milhouse toyed with Bart's anxiety after Bart sold his soul for $5, and Milhouse demanded $50 to return it. On another occasion, Bart introduced Milhouse to his girlfriend and had to explain why he and Milhouse are friends, but could not come up with a good answer and admitted it was due to geographical convenience. Bart did admit in \"Little Orphan Millie\" that he loves Milhouse.\n\nHomer also sometimes makes fun of  Milhouse (once referring to Milhouse in the boy's presence as \"that little wiener\"). In \"Burns, Baby Burns\", Larry, Mr. Burns' son, brings Homer to eat at his house. Mr. Burns was angry and he asks Homer if his son \"brings home nitwits and make you talk to them\", to which Homer answers \"Oh, all the time! Have you ever heard of this kid Milhouse? He's a little wiener who...\", before being interrupted by Burns. In an attempt to purposefully enrage his father, Bart once stated that he felt \"a little attracted to Milhouse\", sending Homer into a rage. Bart and Milhouse appear to be the same height but in the episode \"Radioactive Man\", it is revealed that Milhouse is at least an inch taller than Bart.\n\nMilhouse is frequently the butt of a variety of jokes, ranging from being beaten up by Nelson for delivering a love note from Lisa (which Nelson thought was from Milhouse himself), to having the door slammed in his face while playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey, to having his possible budding homosexuality given away by his school counselor to Homer and Marge by accidentally picking up the wrong folder while discussing Bart, to making him a wanted fugitive (see above), to inadvertently inheriting Bart's dismal permanent record at school through a side deal arranged between Bart, Edna Krabappel and Principal Skinner, which will disqualify Milhouse from \"all but the hottest and noisiest jobs\".\n\nHe is fluent in Italian (\"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\") due to visiting his English language\u2013hating maternal grandmother, Sofia, in Tuscany for two weeks every year. She beat him whenever he spoke English, thus he was forced to learn Italian. He also began bed-wetting that summer. He helps Lisa learn Italian, but there is no reference to his Italian background or language skills in any other episode. Milhouse's personality drastically changes when speaking Italian, becoming a suave, confident ladies man popular with Springfield's Italian community in the episode.\n\nThe show's opening sequence, and various scenes of band practice suggests that Milhouse plays a brass or woodwind instrument, possibly clarinet or trumpet, but all the Springfield Elementary band members, besides Lisa, are very poor musicians.\n\nMilhouse is allergic to honey, wheat, dairy,  mistletoe, holly, the red parts of candy canes and his own tears.\n\nRomance\nMilhouse harbors a crush on Lisa, but they remain close friends, as shown in \"Lisa's Date with Density\", when she admits she liked Nelson. At the end of that episode, after she has stopped liking Nelson, Milhouse asks Lisa who will be her next crush; Lisa coyly answers that it could be anybody and Milhouse rejoices. His feelings for Lisa have been used in episodes set outside of the show's main story line. For example, the episode \"Lisa's Wedding\" shows what the future might hold for Springfield in fifteen years' time. Milhouse is Homer's boss at the nuclear plant, and after learning of Lisa's impending marriage, Milhouse recalls an earlier date with Lisa in which she said she might never marry, then angrily prepares Homer's annual review. Later in the episode, Lisa wonders if it is acceptable to wear a white wedding dress, suggesting that she had already lost her virginity; Marge, her mother, tells her \"Milhouse doesn't count\". In the episode \"Holidays of Future Passed\" (2011), set in the year 2041, Lisa and Milhouse are married and have a daughter, Zia.\n\nLisa has always opposed the idea of going out with Milhouse (e.g. \"Lisa's Date With Density\" and \"Future-Drama\"), however after Milhouse starts tutoring Lisa in Italian and takes her to Springfield's Little Italy, she begins to develop a secret crush on him, until she caught Milhouse with a girl named Angelica in the episode \"The Last of the Red Hat Mamas\", and began hitting him and cursing in Italian just like his grandmother had done.\n\nMilhouse's first real girlfriend was Samantha Stanky, a new student who had moved to Springfield from Phoenix, Arizona in the episode \"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\". After her father who responds to Bart's call caught her and Milhouse kissing, he sent her to a Catholic girls' school run by French-Canadian nuns. While Milhouse's official first kiss was with Samantha Stanky in the aforementioned episode, it was contradicted in the episode \"The Way We Weren't\", where Milhouse accidentally kisses Homer, during a game of spin the bottle that Homer interrupted. In the episode \"Homer Scissorhands\", Milhouse dated a 5th grader, Taffy. The relationship ended when Milhouse and Taffy caught Lisa spying on them in the bushes. Taffy told Lisa that Milhouse still loves her, and Lisa kisses Milhouse. Lisa told Milhouse he should not give up searching for other girls and that life has unexpected things to offer. She told him he is cute in the moonlight, which caused him to fall off a cliff nearly to his death, but a bald eagle caught him, which left him saying \"everything is coming up Milhouse!\"\n\nCreation\nMilhouse was designed by Matt Groening for a Butterfinger commercial, and it was decided to use the character in the series. Milhouse was named after U.S. President Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\". Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\". Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\". His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \"Homer Defined\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends. According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse's look.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Milhouse File\n Milhouse Van Houten on IMDb\n Milhouse Van Houten on Simpsons Wiki\n\nCategory:Child characters in animated films\nCategory:Child characters in television\nCategory:Fictional American people of Dutch descent\nCategory:Fictional American people of Italian descent\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1989\nCategory:Fictional victims of bullies\nCategory:Male characters in animation\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Television sidekicks\nCategory:Male characters in television\n"}, {"id": "BkksMsbxK7Fhz4lF1u0w", "content": "Nelson Muntz\n\nNelson Mandela Muntz is a fictional character and the lead school bully from the animated television series The Simpsons, best known for his signature mocking laugh \"Ha-ha!\". He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and was introduced in Season 1's \"Bart the General\" as an antagonist but later became a close friend of Bart Simpson.\n\nRole in The Simpsons\nNelson is a 12-year-old student and bully at Springfield Elementary School. He is known to have terrorized virtually every kid in Springfield at one point or another. Most often, however, it is the school nerds and less popular students, such as Milhouse and Martin, who are the subject of his cruelty. Nelson shows the occasional glimpse of humanity, though, and other characters have occasionally warmed to him; Lisa dates him briefly in \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Marge informally adopts him in \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", and Bart is shown as a friend to him several times, such as in \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\".\n\nHis family life is dysfunctional. While some early episodes offer inconsistent histories (such as Nelson's dad going insane and abandoning him, Nelson's parents divorcing because of his mom's cough drop addiction, or Nelson's dad in prison while his mom \"has bigger problems\"), the canon story that has evolved is that he lives in a dilapidated house with his mother, who works on the fringes of the sex industry, either as a waitress at Hooters or in a topless bar. The character design and voice portrayal of both parents has varied throughout the course of the series.\n\nIt is shown in many episodes that Nelson's father abandoned him and his mother at an early age when he \"went to pick up some Pop-Tarts\" although, later on in the series, he was said to have gone to pick up a pack of cigarettes. In the fourth-season episode \"Brother from the Same Planet\", Nelson's father is the children's soccer coach who awards Nelson with a free trip to Pele's Soccer and Acting Camp. Nelson's father also appears briefly in the sixth-season episode \"Bart's Girlfriend\", depicted capturing Nelson with a leash as the children run through the cornfields in an attempt to avoid attending church. He also appears in the ninth-season episode \"Bart Star\" to congratulate Nelson after a football game victory and take him to Hooters (with Nelson turning down the invitation because he \"doesn't want to bother [his] Mom at work\"). Nelson's father returns in the sixteenth-season episode \"Sleeping with the Enemy\". It turns out that he did not leave Nelson deliberately; he bit into a chocolate bar, not knowing it had peanuts and had an allergic reaction, covering 90% of his body with large tumors. Looking like Joseph Merrick, he ran out of the store and encountered a circus that made him a part of its freak show. At performances, circus attendees threw peanuts at him, which perpetuated his reaction, preventing him from returning to normal. When the circus came through Springfield, Bart recognized him and brought him home to rid himself of Nelson (who had been taken into the Simpson home by Marge).\n\nNelson is also a natural athlete. In the episode \"Bart Star\", Nelson almost singlehandedly carries the entire Springfield Pee-Wee football team. As the team quarterback, he also on one occasion catches his own pass and plows through the opposing team with extreme ease. In various episodes, he gives out the impression that he is a lot smarter than he may first appear. Nelson often points out painfully obvious things to adults and kids alike that take them longer to grasp. Another example is a running joke where Nelson does a class assignment that is implied to be of high quality. However, he is always brushed off by the teachers before he gets to show them his work. Another running joke, though, is Nelson presenting ridiculously simple assignments, such as repeatedly showing a can of tomato paste in Show and Tell, and a presentation on The Grapes of Wrath, consisting of himself crushing a bunch of grapes with a hammer, stating \"Here's the grapes, and here's the wrath!\" In later episodes, Nelson shows signs of being a tormented artist type, even submitting a film to the Sundance Film Festival about his life as a child living in poverty with a single, unfit mother and no strong father figure. He memorably says in the documentary, \"I like to cry at the ocean, because only there do my tears seem small.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Little Big Girl\", it is revealed that Nelson is German-American. Ironically, in \"Much Apu About Nothing\", Nelson picks on foreign exchange student \u00dcter for being German during Springfield's anti-immigration mania. He is shown to be a big fan of Andy Williams as he, Bart, Milhouse and Martin went to a concert performed by him in \"Bart on the Road\".\n\nRelationships with other characters\nEven though in the first season (and for many seasons afterwards) Nelson seemed to be Bart's antagonist, he eventually becomes what can be considered as Bart's second closest friend after Milhouse.\n\nIn his debut episode, Lisa was the initial target of Nelson's bullying, which prompted Bart to defend her. Bart's actions resulted in frequent beatings by Nelson and his gang, but finally ended when Bart received help from Herman, who came up with the idea of standing up to Nelson and his gang by pelting them with water balloons. From that point on, Nelson shows a grudging respect for Bart, though he occasionally reverts to his past behavior towards him.\n\nAlthough still prone to violence, Nelson hangs out with Bart and his less popular friends, such as Milhouse Van Houten and occasionally even common bullying target Martin Prince. In \"The Debarted\", it is shown that Nelson has become Bart's \"other best friend\", along with Milhouse.\n\nNelson has many other moments where he displays his hidden good nature, such as his brief amorous relationship with Lisa. Although he cannot control his delinquent tendencies, he treats her with respect and even tries to change for her, although both of them realize that he is not being true to himself by doing so. In \"Lisa's Date with Density\", Nelson kisses Lisa, only to be berated by Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, who believe that kissing girls is \"gay\" (despite the events that occurred revolving around Jimbo in \"New Kid On The Block\").\n\nHe also punishes Sherri and Terri for tormenting Lisa. Another curious example of his \"good side\" is with Martin, a boy whom Nelson picks on perhaps more so than any other kid in town. Despite the utter cruelty, there are occasional hints that Nelson does not harbor any real hatred towards Martin and only does so to maintain his 'tough guy' reputation. In \"Dial 'N' for Nerder\", when it is believed that Martin has died, Nelson endeavours to learn the truth and find Martin's killers. When it is revealed that Martin is alive, Nelson mocks and punches him, but also states that he is glad Martin is not dead. In this same episode, however, when Lisa tries to bribe him to not rat her out by offering to get back together with him, he rejects it. In another episode, it is revealed that both Martin and Nelson went to space camp, and that Nelson was a loyal officer to Martin. (See \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\")\n\nIn \"Loan-a Lisa\", Lisa uses $50 to help Nelson fund his bicycle company, which becomes a success. When Nelson almost drops out of school to spend more time on the company, Lisa is saddened and attempts to stop him from doing so, but eventually respects his decision after realising he won't change despite the money used to fund it. Nelson eventually decides not to drop out after all and takes Lisa skating to make it up to her.\n\nThough Nelson is often said to not really have friends aside from his on-and-off relationship with Bart and the others, Nelson sometimes hangs out with his fellow school bullies Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, and (to a lesser extent) two smaller and younger fraternal twin minions known as the Weasels. Though only seen with them occasionally, Nelson is also ironically the leader of the school bullies (possibly by virtue of being the most often seen and most recognizable of the gang).\n\nIn \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", Moe Szyslak appears briefly during a Muntz family reunion. The facial similarities between Moe and the Muntz are surprisingly quite apparent and Moe's childhood experiences and behaviors are somewhat relatable with Nelson's. Moe briefly appears and claims that he is part of the family and is then shunned off screen by the Muntz' confused looks.\n\nCharacter\n\nThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening named Nelson after the wrestling hold of the same name. Cast member Nancy Cartwright voices the character, which first appeared in the fifth episode of the first season, \"Bart the General\" (1990). American voice actress Dana Hill was first supposed to provide Nelson's voice, and attended the read-through of the episode. However, as Cartwright wrote in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, \"the producers were still putting together this ensemble of [actors] and, come Monday, at the recording, she was nowhere to be found and the part was assigned to me. I didn't have time to ask why and I still don't have a clue.\" Cartwright also commented that when she first found out she would be voicing Nelson, \"I asked myself, 'What does a bully sound like?' Well... what you hear is what you get. When I first uttered, 'I'll get you after school, man!' I let out a sigh of relief when I got through the line and a double-sigh when it got a laugh.\"\n\nBy the eighth season of The Simpsons, the writers had begun to explore the secondary characters of the show. \"Lisa's Date with Density\" (season eighth, 1996) was the first episode to center around Nelson and was used to explain why he acts the way he does. The idea of Nelson dating Lisa Simpson had already been around for a while, but this was the first time that the staff worked it into the show. Cartwright said in 2012 that she thinks Nelson \"has evolved the most out of all the characters I do. There's a soft spot in him that the writers have found. He's got this special attraction to Marge, and he sings these songs, and he's got a crush on Lisa. There's something about this poor kid\u00a0\u2013 his mother works at Hooters, his dad went out to buy milk and never came back. I wouldn't want him to come over for dinner, but I really love doing his voice.\"\n\nReception\nThe episode \"The Haw-Hawed Couple\" in 2007 was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. The writer of the episode Matt Selman was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award.\n\nIn his review of the season 22 episode \"Loan-a Lisa\", Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club commented that Nelson's character has undergone a \"Spikeification\", in reference to the bully's near-exclusive portrayal as being likable and vulnerable in later seasons of the program.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1990\nCategory:Child characters in television\nCategory:Child characters in animated films\nCategory:Male characters in television\nCategory:Fictional bullies\nCategory:Fictional American people of German descent\nCategory:Male characters in animation\nCategory:Fictional players of American football\n\nde:Figuren aus Die Simpsons#Nelson Muntz\n"}, {"id": "BkksMLTxK6wAkr3vLz9p", "content": "Ralph Wiggum\n\nRalph Wiggum is a recurring character on the animated series The Simpsons, voiced by Nancy Cartwright. The son of Police Chief Wiggum, Ralph is a classmate of Lisa Simpson and an odd child noted for his frequent non-sequiturs and bizarre behavior. His lines range from nonsensical, or bizarre interpretations of a current event, to profound statements that go over people's heads; and his behavior varies between blissfully unaware, to dim-witted, to awkwardly spontaneous, even occasionally straightforward. The very nature of the character has undergone differing interpretations over the years and within various media.\n\nThe creator of the show, Matt Groening, has cited Ralph as his favorite character. He generally remains one of the more popular and often quoted secondary characters in the show. In 2006, IGN ranked Ralph No. 3 on their list of the \"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters,\" behind Sideshow Bob and Troy McClure.\n\nRole in The Simpsons\nRalph is a simple-minded but good-natured 8-year-old boy in Lisa Simpson's second-grade class taught by Ms. Hoover. Although his beginnings were that of a tertiary child character along the same lines as Lisa's on-and-off friend Janey, he has since become one of the more prominent secondary characters on the show, even being the focus or at least a major character of some episodes.\n\nTo date, these include: \"I Love Lisa\" (season four, 1993), an episode which set him apart from other tertiary characters and defined much of the character, \"This Little Wiggy\" (season nine, 1998), and \"E Pluribus Wiggum\" (season nineteen, 2008); as well as appearances both minor and prominent in many other episodes. Ralph also appears in various other media, such as the Simpsons comic book by Bongo.\n\nPersonality\nRalph's primary role in the show is to deliver tangent and non-sequitur material, usually with cluelessness and odd behavior often used to perplex or give the audience a quick laugh. He has a very carefree and somewhat \"loopy\" temperament, as he is often off in his own world. This role has had many variations over the years and as such Ralph often displays inconsistent behavior. In some episodes he may seem quite stupid, verbally challenged, and slow such as proclaiming \"I won, I won!\" when being told he was failing English, then questioning it and saying, \"Me fail English? That's unpossible!\", or running on all fours on a hamster wheel. In \"To Cur with Love\", a flashback scene shows Chief Wiggum and Lou talking about what they want to be when they grow up.  Lou (after hearing that Wiggum's goal in life is to be chief of police) says he wants \"to be a leader for his people, like Ralph Abernathy,\"  to which Wiggum says \"Ralph. I like that name\" implying that Ralph was named after him. Although it has never been explicitly stated in any Simpsons-related media that Ralph is intellectually disabled and/or brain damaged, it has been hinted in scenes such as a flashback where Chief Wiggum is holding a baby Ralph, who is drinking out of a bottle; Wiggum suddenly drops the baby Ralph, who lands flat on his head. When Wiggum picks Ralph up again, Ralph suddenly has difficulty drinking out of his bottle. In other episodes, he speaks in a perfectly normal tone and occasionally even displays taciturn behavior such as questioning a film production staff member over the use of a painted cow over a horse, seemingly playing straight man to Bart as an adult in one possible flashforward, or his overall behavior in the episode \"I Love Lisa\", in which Ralph played a central role. He even occasionally displays a penchant for certain talents. The inconclusive nature of his character seems to be one of his only consistencies, and has even been used as a joke in itself a few times such as Ralph being poached by the Chicago Tribune. Occasionally, Ralph has even been used to break the fourth wall straightforwardly.\n\nRalph has a multitude of surprising, often creativity-based talents as well as his share of flaws and quirks. He was once chosen as the first pick for the 76ers. The most prominent of these talents as displayed in \"I Love Lisa\" is performing and acting. Playing the role of George Washington in a school play based on his life, he not only recited his lines perfectly but also managed to give such an amazing performance that he brought the audience to tears. He can also tap dance, paint, play the piano and sing among other things. This is probably attributed to the boy's rich imagination, though this quality also leads to some of Ralph's more peculiar characteristics such as his penchant for imaginary friends, including a pyromaniacal leprechaun, and Wiggle-Puppy, a character he seems personally very fond of. The character also seems to have a rather large number of phobias, like being afraid of the vacuum, indulges in many odd habits, and has a knack for landing himself in peculiar situations such as gluing his shoulder to his ear, being profiled by a scary dentist, or even flying with balloons. The character's temperament has notably changed over the years; originally depicted as more awkward and oblivious but otherwise normal, after a time his more \"stupid\" characteristics became far more exaggerated though this has been mitigated somewhat as of late in favor of plain weirdness that shows in quotes such as \"The doctor says that my nose would stop bleeding if I just kept my finger out of there\" and \"I'm lernding\" and strange outbursts like \"Hi liar\". Ralph still wets himself, and it is a recurring gag in the show when he does so and announces it to someone in an unusual way.\n\nRalph is the only child of Chief Wiggum and his wife Sarah. Chief Wiggum adores his son who returns this affection in turn, though Ralph can be quite a handful. Chief Wiggum's supportive and loving relationship with his son is often depicted as one of his more sympathetic characteristics to contrast his generally boorish behavior. Ralph also has an unrequited crush on Lisa Simpson originating in \"I Love Lisa\", although this has not been frequently seen in the series since. As Ralph is often blissfully oblivious to the world around him, he remains a generally cheerful boy. He is a misfit at school due to his unique behavior and poor academic performance, often being the butt of ridicule and occasional bullying. Generally, however, his peers are passive towards him, and Ralph often tags along with Bart, Milhouse, and Martin in particular. Much of the faculty similarly are indifferent to Ralph: Mrs. Hoover in particular treats him with a sort of mild annoyance, and Principal Skinner seems to see him as something of a nuisance due to his poor test results and hijinks. Ralph is occasionally used as a catalyst for satire about public education's failings because of this, as he may be merely a victim of inflexible and incompetent teaching. He may not be as dim as his academic performance shows.\n\nCreation and design\nIn Ralph's first credited appearance in the show, the episode \"Moaning Lisa\", he was considerably different in both appearance and behavior from his later appearance. Ralph's modern design first appeared in the second-season episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\", and in a couple of episodes after this Ralph can be caught speaking with a voice similar to that of Nelson Muntz's, before acquiring the higher pitched voice that would become permanent after. Originally intended to be a \"Mini-Homer\", Ralph eventually took on a life of his own. The staff figured that he would also fit perfectly as the son of Chief Wiggum, a fact initially hinted at in \"Kamp Krusty\" (when Lisa addresses him as \"Wiggum\") and later made canon in \"I Love Lisa\". Ralph was named after comedian Jackie Gleason's character on The Honeymooners Ralph Kramden. Matt Groening considers any lines for Ralph \"really hard to write.\" Nancy Cartwright raises her eyebrows whenever she performs Ralph's voice.\n\nRalph's normal attire usually consists of a blue long sleeve shirt with a collar, a belt with a red buckle, and brown pants. However, almost all Simpsons related media and merchandise including the comic book often portray Ralph with white or light gray colored pants instead similar to how Bart is occasionally depicted with a blue shirt instead of his standard orange shirt. Ralph's \"stringy\" hair is meant to be drawn to make the shape of a bowl-cut, and may allude to Eddie (who has similar hair) being his biological father. In one particular issue of the comic book, Ralph appears along with other Springfield residents drawn in a realistic style which depicts him with blonde hair, implying that the hair lines are meant to be a silhouette of a blonde bowl-cut. Adult Ralph in \"Bart to the Future\" also has light brown hair.\n\nReception\nRalph has become one of the show's most popular characters. He is commonly featured on media and merchandise related to the show, including the season 13 box set. Kidrobot released Ralph as a separate figure from the rest of their Simpsons line of figurines in 2009. The figure is twice as large as the other ones. The comedy band The Bloodhound Gang made a song titled \"Ralph Wiggum\" on the album Hefty Fine, dedicated to the character and composed solely of some of his most famous quotes for lyrics. Show creator Matt Groening has stated that whenever someone asks who writes specific characters (a common misconception about the writing process), writers will most likely take credit for writing for Ralph.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1989\nCategory:Male characters in television\nCategory:Child characters in television\nCategory:Child characters in animated films\nCategory:Fictional American people of Irish descent\nCategory:Fictional victims of bullies\nCategory:Male characters in animation\n\nde:Figuren aus Die Simpsons#Ralph Wiggum\n"}, {"id": "BkksLQrxK0fuNaVtwDG3", "content": "Chief Wiggum\n\nChief Clancy Wiggum is a fictional character from the animated television series The Simpsons, voiced by Hank Azaria. He is the chief of police in the show's setting of Springfield, and is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the husband of Sarah Wiggum.\n\nThe character's comedic value relies heavily on his immense incompetence and irresponsibility as a police officer, as well as his laziness and gluttony. Chief Wiggum's more responsible fellow officers Eddie and Lou play the straight men to his shenanigans.\n\nCharacter development \n\nHis surname \"Wiggum\" is Matt Groening's mother's maiden name. As \"a conscious pun\", Wiggum was designed to look like a pig. Hank Azaria first based his voice for Wiggum on David Brinkley, but it was too slow and he switched it to an Edward G. Robinson impression.\n\nBiography \n\nChief Wiggum is of Irish descent. Per the episode \"Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in \"The Curse of the Flying Hellfish\"\", Wiggum's father Iggy served in Abe Simpson's infantry squad, implying the Wiggums emigrated to America by the early 1940s at the latest. In the episode \"Mother Simpson\", a teenaged Wiggum was a trainee security guard at Springfield University when Homer's mother Mona sabotaged the University's laboratory, which Mr. Burns was using for biological weapons. Antibiotics used to kill the weapons cured Wiggum's asthma, allowing him to join the police force.\n\nMany episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum, despite his incompetence, occupies such a high rank in the police force. As with those of most supporting characters on the show, they are jokes for one episode and contradict each other. Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for Springfield's state in the 2005 episode \"Pranksta Rap\". He also appeared on Halloween novel depicting Stranger Things as chief Jim Hopper.\n\nPositive qualities \n\nDespite his severe incompetence at his occupation, Wiggum on occasion has helped various other characters, such as helping Homer find his wife in \"Marge on the Lam\". He rescued Maggie Simpson when she ran away from home to look for Marge in \"Homer Alone\", by helping Lisa Simpson find Mr. Burns' assailant in \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\" as well as helping backing her up in a school protest on one occasion in \"The President Wore Pearls\". In the episode \"Pranksta Rap\" he manages to find the presumed kidnapped Bart Simpson in Kirk Van Houten's apartment. He also arrived just in time during crucial moments such as the various times Sideshow Bob had attempted to kill Bart Simpson. Perhaps the best example of this is the episode \"Mother Simpson\", where it is implied that he leads the FBI astray in their search for Mona Simpson, allowing her to escape in gratitude for curing his asthma. Although Wiggum can often antagonize others as well, it is heavily implied that it is not out of malice but merely because he is doing his job or because he is ignorant of the situation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Chief Wiggum on IMDb\n\nCategory:Fictional American people of Irish descent\nCategory:Fictional American police officers\nCategory:Television characters introduced in 1990\nCategory:Fictional police commissioners\nCategory:Male characters in animation\nCategory:The Simpsons characters\nCategory:Cultural depictions of Edward G.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 8, 2006. Mail from forty years earlier is discovered, and a letter from Homer Simpson's mother's old boyfriend states that he is Homer's true father. Homer sets out to find his supposed new father, leaving Abe Simpson behind. It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Mike B. Anderson. The episode guest stars William H. Macy and Joe Frazier as themselves, and Michael York as Homer's new father, Mason Fairbanks.\n\nPlot\nAs Marge drives on a highway to go shopping, she finds a toll booth, but she and other Springfield residents drive through an adjacent forest trail to avoid paying. A week later, Mayor Quimby enforces tire spikes and blocks off the escape route, needing money to \"de-python\" the town fountain. When Marge comes up to the booth, she refuses to pay and backs up, blowing out many cars' tires, which are thrown in the tire fire. The heat and smoke from it melts ice on Mount Springfield and reveals a mailman frozen for 40 years. His letters contain many revelations and one is delivered to Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. It is from her old lifeguard boyfriend, whose name begins with an M, who writes that if Mona replies to the letter, she has chosen him, and if she does not, she is choosing to stick with her husband, Abe, and that either way, he knows the baby she is carrying is his.\n\nWondering who his biological father really is, Homer goes to the library to look in \"Lifeguards of Springfield in the Twentieth Century.\" The only person in there whose name begins with M is Mason Fairbanks. Homer goes to his house posing a reporter, but eventually tells him he thinks he is his father, and Mason is delighted. He takes the Simpson family on a ride on his ship and tells them the story of the lost emerald treasure of Piso Mojado, which impresses them. However, when they come home, Grampa angrily accuses Mason of having tried to steal his wife and now trying to steal his family, and is saddened Homer would even think that Mason could be his real father. They have a DNA test, and after a suspenseful wait, Homer is thrilled to learn his real father is Mason Fairbanks.\n\nWhile Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie have an awkward, uneventful visit with Grampa, Mason and Homer are underwater in individual submarines looking for the lost treasure. Homer gets separated from Mason, and he follows a small light, thinking it is him. It is actually a glowing fish, and Homer gets stuck in some coral. As his oxygen begins to run out and he starts to lose consciousness, he sees poignant flashbacks of himself and Abe. After three days in a coma, Homer wakes up in a hospital, tells Abe of his memories, and says he considers Abe his real father. Abe then reveals he switched the labels on the DNA samples after seeing how happy Homer was with Mason and the fully confirmed biological father-son duo share a hug.\n\nReception\n\nRyan J. Budke of TV Squad gives the episode a strong positive rating, quoting its ingenuity and charm. He calls it a funny episode with a lot of heart, and quotes that it was a great episode by comparing it alongside his other favorite, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Homer's Paternity Coot\" at The Simpsons.com\n\nCategory:2006 American television episodes\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes\n"}, {"id": "BkksLRbxK1TjZJ7cqHRp", "content": "Mother Simpson\n\n\"Mother Simpson\" is the eighth episode of The Simpsons' seventh season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19, 1995. After faking his own death to get a day off work, Homer reunites with his mother Mona, who he thought had died 27 years ago. It was directed by David Silverman and was the first episode to be written by Richard Appel. Glenn Close makes her first of seven guest appearances as Homer's mother.\n\nPlot\n\nUpon learning that Mr. Burns wants all of his employees to clean up a highway maintained by his company on Saturday, Homer, seeking to get out of his work, fakes his own death using a dummy. The next day, Marge finds out and orders Homer to go to the Springfield Hall of Records to explain himself. While sorting out the problem, Homer gets into an argument with a clerk who claims that Homer's mother is still alive, in spite of his belief that she died when he was young. Seeking to prove that she is really dead, Homer visits what he believes to be her grave, only to discover that it belongs to Walt Whitman. After falling into a grave that had been dug for his \"corpse\", Homer finds himself approached by a woman who chastises him for falling into her son's grave, and recognizes her as his mother Mona, leading the two to share an emotional reunion.\n\nBringing her home to meet with his family, Lisa soon bonds with her paternal grandmother, but while the two are sitting on the front steps during a conversation between them, Mona runs inside the house when a police car drives by. Suspicious, Lisa shares her concerns with Bart, who had raided Mona's purse and found several driver's licenses with different names, while Marge and Homer begin to wonder why Mona left her son and never returned for 27 years. The family soon decide to confront Mona, who reveals the truth about her disappearance. In 1969, Mona became inspired by a group of hippies and their beliefs, and soon joined them in protesting against a germ warfare laboratory owned by Mr. Burns, which was deliberately trying to poison everyone in Springfield. The group soon detonated an \"antibiotic bomb\" inside the lab, killing all the germs. An angry Burns attempted to stop the hippies, but was trampled by them. While fleeing with them, Mona went back to help Burns, but she was recognized as one of the perpetrators, forcing her to leave Homer and his father Abe and go into hiding.\n\nUpon learning that Mona had sent Homer a care package every week she was gone, but that he never received them, the pair head to the post office to claim them. But while there, Burns recognizes Mona, and calls in the FBI, who track her to the Simpsons home. Before she can be arrested, Homer receives an anonymous tip-off that his mother is about to be arrested, and escapes with her. The tipster is later revealed to be Chief Wiggum, who had been a security guard at Burns' lab until the antibiotic mist cured him of the asthma that had prevented him from joining the police academy. Learning she must go into hiding once more, Mona and Homer say goodbye, and she departs with another group of hippies. After she leaves, Homer remains well into the night, sitting alone on his car and watching the stars.\n\nProduction\n\nThe idea for \"Mother Simpson\" was pitched by Richard Appel, who decided to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was that they were able to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when he watches the ending.\n\nGlenn Close, who was directed by Josh Weinstein, was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks. Mona Simpson was designed in a way so that she would somewhat resemble Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns. The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist Mona Simpson. When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say \"d'oh!\" properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.\n\nThe design of Joe Friday is based on his design in \"Dragged Net!\", a parody of Dragnet that was done in Mad Magazine in the 1950s. Mona becoming a radical after seeing Joe Namath's sideburns is a parody of how many 1960s films have a sudden transformational moment and play music such as \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" and there was much discussion among the writers as to what that moment should be. The song originally intended to be taped over Mr. Burns' cassette of \"Ride of the Valkyries\" was \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\", but it was too expensive to clear, so ABBA\u2019s \"Waterloo\" was selected instead.\n\nCultural references\n\"Mother Simpson\" draws upon a number of references to 1960s popular culture. Three songs from the 1960s appear in this episode: \"Sunshine of Your Love\" by Cream, \"Blowin' in the Wind\" by Bob Dylan, and the Jimi Hendrix cover of \"All Along the Watchtower\". Mona Simpson is seen reading Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman. Mona mentions that she worked a number of jobs while on the run, including \"marketing Jerry Rubin\u2019s line of diet shakes, proofreading Bobby Seale's cookbook, and running credit checks at Tom Hayden\u2019s Porsche dealership.\" Rubin, Seale and Hayden were three liberal radicals from the 1960s. Rubin did indeed have a line of diet shakes, and Bobby Seale did write some cookbooks. However, Tom Hayden never owned a Porsche dealership.\n\nThe radicals use a Spiro Agnew alarm clock, which is based on a real item. When Mr. Burns drives a tank towards the Simpson house, he is wearing oversized headgear. This is a reference to a public relations stunt by Michael Dukakis during his campaign in the 1988 presidential election. When Mr. Burns plays a tape of \"Ride of the Valkyries\", it has been recorded over by Smithers with \"Waterloo\" by ABBA, a reference to Smithers' implied homosexuality and to the helicopter beach attack scene in Apocalypse Now, in which \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is famously played. The scene from Apocalypse Now was in tern a reference to the climax of the 1915 silent film The Birth of a Nation. Maggie is shown dancing in her diaper and covered in slogans in a parody of the filler scenes of Laugh-In in which Goldie Hawn and other female cast members like Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley danced in a bikini with slogans and drawings painted on their bodies. The two FBI agents are Joe Friday and Bill Gannon from Dragnet. Bill Gannon is voiced by Harry Morgan, the man who played Gannon in the original series.\n\nReception\nIn its original broadcast, \"Mother Simpson\" finished 45th in ratings for the week of November 13 \u2013 19, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 10.0, equivalent to approximately 9.6 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210, The X-Files, and Melrose Place.\n\n\"Mother Simpson\" is one of Oakley and Weinstein's favorite episodes; they have called it a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes, and an interesting story. In 1996, \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" was submitted for the Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)\" category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which they felt would have given it the edge. Pinky and the Brain eventually went on to win. Bill Oakley feels that had this episode been submitted, it would have easily won. The joke about Homer apparently being familiar with Walt Whitman is one of David Silverman's favorite jokes.\n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it \"Gag-packed, and very touching\".\n\nIGN ranked Glenn Close's performance as the 25th best guest appearance in the show's history. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named Close one of the 16 best The Simpsons guest stars.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Mother Simpson\" at The Simpsons.com\n\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 7) episodes\nCategory:1995 American television episodes\n"}, {"id": "BkksMPLxK0fuOFQ0VDB6", "content": "Treehouse of Horror VIII\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" is the fourth episode of The Simpsons' ninth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 26, 1997. In the eighth annual Treehouse of Horror episode, Homer Simpson is the last man left alive when a neutron bomb destroys Springfield until a gang of mutants come after him, Homer buys a transporter that Bart uses to switch bodies with a housefly, and Marge is accused of witchcraft in a Puritan rendition of Springfield in 1649. It was written by Mike Scully, David X. Cohen and Ned Goldreyer, and was directed by Mark Kirkland.\n\nPlot\n\nOpening\nA Fox censor is sitting at his desk going through the show's script, censoring some things and explaining to the audience that the episode is rated TV-G with no violence or anything explicit. As he continues talking, a hand reaches with a cutlass from the rating and stabs the censor many times with the rating changing from G to PG to 14 to MA to (the fictional) 21 to TV-666. He falls on his desk dead and his blood spells the name of the episode.\n\nThe H\u03a9mega Man\n\nWhen Mayor Quimby makes an offensive joke about France, and refuses to apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter and seems to be the only person in town to survive the blast. Initially grieving for his loved ones, Homer perks up from realizing that he is the last person alive and it gives him an excuse to do everything he always wanted to do but couldn\u2019t. While dancing naked in a church, he is confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants from the blast. Homer flees back to his home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its many layers of lead paint, turning it into the ideal bomb shelter. Marge and the children finally kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.\n\nFly vs. Fly\nHomer buys a matter transporter from Professor Frink. That night, Bart sees the family pets inadvertently go through the transporter together and he steps into the teleporter with a fly on his arm, thinking that he will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees this as an opportunity to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.\n\nEasy-Bake Coven\nIn 1649, the town is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople try to figure out whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is entitled to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.\n\nProduction\n\n\"The H\u03a9mega Man\" was written by Mike Scully, \"Fly Vs. Fly\" was written by David X. Cohen, and \"Easy-Bake Coven\" was written by Ned Goldreyer. Large portions of the \"Fly vs. Fly\" segment were cut, including the original ending where the fly also emerges from the teleporter, but is considerably larger and the Simpson family ride it to the mall.\n\nThe producers had trouble with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor (pictured on the right) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and had a difficult time getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.\n\nThis episode was the only Treehouse of Horror episode that was directed by Mark Kirkland. It was also the last episode Brad Bird worked on; he left the show to direct The Iron Giant. \"Easy-Bake Coven\" was storyboarded by Kirkland and the backgrounds were designed by Lance Wilder. Although Kang and Kodos make brief appearances in every Treehouse of Horror episode, their brief appearance in this one was nearly cut. David X. Cohen managed to persuade the producers to leave the scene in.\n\nCultural references\nAs with the majority of the Treehouse of Horror episodes, numerous cultural references are made throughout the episode. \"The H\u03a9mega Man\" is an extended homage to film The Omega Man, which was one of Mike Scully's favorite movies as a child. In the same segment, Homer runs over Johnny and Edgar Winter while fleeing the mutants pursuing him, mistaking them as mutants as the Winter brothers are both albino.\n\nThe title \"Fly vs. Fly\" is a reference to the Mad magazine comic strip \"Spy vs. Spy\", while the segment itself is based on the film The Fly. In \"Easy-Bake Coven\", the animators referenced the film The Crucible for many of their designs, and Edna Krabappel is wearing a Scarlet A, which is a reference to the novel The Scarlet Letter.\n\nReception\nIn its original broadcast, \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" finished 18th in ratings for the week of October 20\u201326, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 11.2, equivalent to  approximately 10.9 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating King of the Hill.\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" won a Golden Reel Award in 1998 for \"Best Sound Editing \u2013 Television Animated Specials\" for Robert Mackston, Travis Powers, Norm MacLeod and Terry Greene. Alf Clausen received an Emmy Award nomination for \"Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)\" for this episode, which he ultimately lost. The A.V. Club named Comic Book Guy's line \"Oh, I've wasted my life\" as one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" at The Simpsons.com\n\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 9) episodes\nCategory:1997 American television episodes\nCategory:Treehouse of Horror (series)\nCategory:Halloween television episodes\nCategory:Television episodes about witchcraft\nCategory:Television series sets in the 1640s\nCategory:Salem witch trials in fiction\nCategory:Fiction about shapeshifting\nCategory:Television episodes written by David X.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 27, 1996. In the seventh annual Treehouse of Horror episode, Bart discovers his long-lost twin, Lisa grows a colony of small beings, and Kang and Kodos impersonate Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in order to win the 1996 presidential election. It was written by Ken Keeler, Dan Greaney, and David S. Cohen, and directed by Mike B. Anderson. Phil Hartman provided the voice of Bill Clinton.\n\nPlot\n\n\"The Thing and I\"\nBart and Lisa begin to hear strange noises coming from the attic. Homer claims not to know what they are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and discover there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a siamese twin brother named Hugo. The two were conjoined twins separated soon after birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to search for Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. Bart responds by telling them not to look so surprised. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic with Hugo's bucket of living fish heads to eat.\n\n\"The Genesis Tub\"\nLisa performs a science experiment to see if cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa as part of his project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate (evolving to the point of the Reformation by the time Lisa has come back from breakfast). Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and Lisa responds by insulting him under her breath. The now futuristic tub people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack Bart. Lisa is then threatened by Bart, who says he will destroy the tiny world when she is not around. Lisa is then shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some nice shoes and some socks too.\n\n\"Citizen Kang\"\nWhile out fishing, Homer is abducted by the two aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton from the White House and the Republican National Committee, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through \"bio-duplication\" to ensure that one of them will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, so nobody will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton from the suspended animation tubes. Both candidates agree they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that they still have to choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates, and voting for a third party candidate has never worked before. Kang is subsequently elected President of the United States and enslaves all of humanity, including the Simpsons themselves. Although a slave for life, Homer proudly boasts that he voted for Kodos.\n\nProduction\nLike the previous two Treehouse of Horror episodes, \"Treehouse of Horror VII\" does not feature any wraparound segments. \"The Thing and I\" was written by Ken Keeler, \"The Genesis Tub\" was written by Dan Greaney, and \"Citizen Kang\" was written by David X. Cohen. Despite the similarities, \"The Thing and I\" was not based on the plot of the 1982 film Basket Case. \"The Genesis Tub\" was originally pitched by Cohen, and it was later referenced in the South Park episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\", when they pointed out that The Simpsons had gotten the idea from the 1962 Twilight Zone episode called \"The Little People\". The sequence where tiny spaceships attack Bart in \"The Genesis Tub\" marks one of the first uses of computers in The Simpsons animation. The computer was used to build models for reference and the animators later retraced it. The 1996 Presidential election occurred a few days after the airing of this episode. According to Cohen, the \"Citizen Kang\" short violated every rule of The Simpsons as it locked the episode in one time and named specific candidates.\n\nCultural references\nIn \"The Thing and I\", Homer sings \"Fish Heads\", a 1980 novelty song by Barnes & Barnes. Homer crashing the flying saucer into Capitol dome in the \"Citizen Kang\" segment is a reference to Earth vs. the Flying Saucers, a 1956 film. In \"The Genesis Tub\", the Tooth City space ships that attacked Bart strongly resembled the Transformers Decepticon character Scourge's vehicle form.\n\nReception\nIn its original broadcast, \"Treehouse of Horror VII\" finished 31st in ratings for the week of October 21\u201327, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 10.5, equivalent to approximately 10.2\u00a0million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Millennium and The X-Files.\n\nIn 2017, IGN called \"Citizen Kang\" the best segment of the entire anthology, and placed the episode itself as number one in its ranking of all \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes. The A.V. Club named Kang/Bob Dole's line, \"Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others!\", one of the best lines in the history of the show.\n\nThe ska punk band named I Voted for Kodos takes its name from Homer's line, \"Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos\", at the end of \"Citizen Kang\". In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article, Matt Groening ranked this episode as his seventh favorite in the history of the show.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror VII\" at The Simpsons.com\n\nCategory:1996 American television episodes\nCategory:Television episodes about alien invasion\nCategory:Bob Dole\nCategory:Cultural depictions of Bill Clinton\nCategory:Fiction about size change\nCategory:Television episodes about elections\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 8) episodes\nCategory:Television episodes written by David X.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 6, 2005. In the sixteenth annual Treehouse of Horror, the Simpsons replace Bart with a robot son after Bart falls into a coma, Homer and various other male characters find themselves on a reality show where Mr. Burns hunts humans for sport, and costumed Springfieldians become whatever they are wearing, thanks to a witch who was disqualified from a Halloween costume contest. It was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by David Silverman. Terry Bradshaw and Dennis Rodman guest star as themselves. Around 11.63 million Americans tuned in to watch the episode during its original broadcast.\n\nPlot\nIn the opening, Kang hopes to speed up an exceedingly slow and boring baseball game, despite Kodos' protests, but ends up destroying the universe when the baseball players go so fast, they turn into a killer vortex which sucks up the universe, even God. When Kodos berates Kang off-camera for destroying the universe, Kang responds by leaving a post-it note on the white void, revealing the title of the episode.\n\nB.I. Bartificial Intelligence\nIn a parody of A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Bart winds up in a two-week coma after attempting to jump out of a window into a swimming pool. The family takes in a robotic boy, named David, who quickly proves to be a better son. Bart wakes up from his two-week coma and competes against David for the affection of the rest of his family. However, Bart is dumped on a road by Homer, who decides to keep David instead. When Bart finds a group of old rusty robots, he steals their parts to become a cyborg, returns home and saws David in half with a chainsaw when David tries to use Homer as a shield, and Bart (angry that Homer abandoned him) cuts though both of them. Although the family is now together again, Homer is angry that he has to be fused with David's lower half, which soon collapses due to Homer's weight. Suddenly, the whole scenario is revealed to be a dream conjured by Homer's demonically possessed mind as he is being exorcised. Marge reluctantly says she'll call work and tell them Homer can't make it in, much to his delight.\n\nSurvival of the Fattest\nIn a parody of The Most Dangerous Game, men from Springfield arrive at Mr. Burns' mansion to go hunting. Unbeknownst to them, they are the prey to be hunted and broadcast on television. Homer manages to survive the night while the others are killed left and right, but Burns closes in on him in the morning. Just as he is about to be shot, Burns and Smithers are knocked out by Marge with a frying pan in each hand, who then hits Homer on the head for being away from home for 18 hours without calling, before they end up having make-up sex behind the astonished newscasters.\n\nI've Grown a Costume on Your Face\nIn a parody of Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode \"Halloween\" and the classic Twilight Zone episode \"The Masks\", the citizens of Springfield dress in their Halloween costumes for a costume contest that involves courage, bravery and happiness. The winner is declared to be a strange old witch with a green skin and a black-and-red suit. When given the award and asked who she is, she is forced to admit that she is a real witch. As a result, her reward is rescinded because she is not in actual costume and is sentenced to four weeks in jail as a punishment for admitting a secret silliness. In anger of such harsh punishment, she turns everyone into their costumed characters, just before being put into custody. The only person who can reverse the spell is Maggie, who was costumed as a witch. Maggie turns them all into pacifiers with their normal heads instead, flying off on a broom to seek help after this mistake she made. The segment ends as Moe and a transformed Dennis Rodman talk to the audience about the importance of reading, before Maggie returns and casts another spell, presumably turning everyone back to normal.\n\nReception\n\nExternal links\n\nTreehouse of Horror XVI script at Springfield!

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 30, 1994, and features three short stories titled The Shinning, Time and Punishment, and Nightmare Cafeteria. \n\nThe episode was written by Greg Daniels, Dan McGrath, David Cohen and Bob Kushell, and directed by Jim Reardon. \nIn The Shinning, the Simpsons are hired as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Deprived of television and beer, Homer becomes insane and attempts to murder the family. In Time and Punishment, Homer repeatedly travels back in time and alters the future. In Nightmare Cafeteria, Principal Skinner begins using students in detention as cafeteria food.\n\nDavid Mirkin deliberately placed more graphic violence in the episode due to complaints about excessive violence in the show. The episode features James Earl Jones as the voice of an alternate timeline Maggie. The episode was critically acclaimed, with The Shinning segment receiving the most praise.\n\nPlot\n\nOpening\nMarge warns that the episode is frightening and should not be viewed by children. During the warning, she is informed that it is so scary that the Congress will not allow the episode to be broadcast instead censor it with 200 Miles to Oregon. However, Bart and Homer interrupt the warning with a radio transmission and the episode begins.\n\nThe Shinning\nThe Simpson family are employed as caretakers at Mr. Burns' mansion. Mr. Burns cuts the cable television wire and confiscates the beer, thinking this will ensure hard work from the family. While there, Groundskeeper Willie discovers that Bart has power to read his thoughts and says that if Homer goes insane, he should use this to summon him. The deprivation of his two favorite things causes Homer to go insane and a ghost Moe informs Homer he must kill his family in order to get a beer. Marge is attacked by Homer and fends him off with a baseball bat; Homer faints in horror after foolishly looking in a nearby mirror, so Marge locks him in the pantry until he has calmed down. Minutes later, Homer is back to himself eating happily until Moe and a gang of ghouls drag him back out of the pantry.\n\nWhile Marge and the children are enjoying dinner, Homer begins pursuing the family with an axe. Bart uses his powers to summon Willie, who immediately runs to the family's rescue, abandoning his portable television in the snow in the process. Homer kills him by striking him in the back with the axe. Homer pursues his family outside but as he is about to kill them, Lisa discovers Willie's abandoned television. Homer's insanity gradually abates and the family freezes in the snow as they are watching.\n\nTime and Punishment\nOne morning at breakfast, Homer gets his hand stuck in the toaster twice and breaks it. While attempting to fix it, he accidentally turns it into a time machine, as seen with a test-toast that transports him to prehistoric times, where he realizes he must be careful not to do anything to change history. Coincidentally, swatting a mosquito turns the present into a dystopia where Ned Flanders rules the world. Homer travels back in time again attempting to set things right; however, he accidentally kills a walking fish, and after returning to the present, he finds Bart and Lisa as giants, narrowly avoiding being crushed by them. His next attempt results in him accidentally releasing the common cold while fleeing from a Tyrannosaurus, which causes the dinosaurs' extinction. He is initially pleased with the results in the present (amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died), but is horrified upon discovering that no one knows what donuts are and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe by Maggie, who then speaks to Homer in James Earl Jones' voice. On his next trip back, Homer smashes and crushes everything in sight. He arrives in a reality that appears normal; he finds the rest of the Simpson family eating with amphibian tongues, but decides that it is \"close enough\".\n\nNightmare Cafeteria\nPrincipal Skinner is concerned that the detention hall is becoming overcrowded and as a result of the latest budget cut, Lunchlady Doris has been reduced to serving \"Grade F\" meat in the cafeteria. Skinner discovers a common solution: eating children. Jimbo Jones is the first student to be killed, followed by \u00dcter. Bart and Lisa finally discover what Principal Skinner and Lunchlady Doris are doing, but one by one, the kids are \"sent to detention\" where they are caged and butchered. Eventually Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse are among the only students remaining and attempt to escape. Skinner and Doris corner them on a ledge above a giant food processor. Willie attempts to help the students escape, but is once again felled with an axe in the back, this time by Principal Skinner. Milhouse, Bart, and Lisa fall to their demise.\n\nBart wakes up from the nightmare to find his family beside his bed. Marge assures him he has nothing to be afraid of, \"except for that fog that turns people inside out\", which then seeps in through the window and turns the Simpsons inside out. They all perform a musical number with Willie over the end credits, but Bart is dragged away by Santa's Little Helper.\n\nProduction\nDavid Mirkin attempted to put \"as much blood and guts\" into the episode as he could. This was because Mirkin was disappointed by complaints from Congress regarding the amount of violence in the show and their attempts for it to be censored. He later called it \"the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever\". The opening sequence, in which Marge states the episode could not be shown and plays some live action stock footage, was also in reaction to this. Mirkin said he thinks Halloween shows can be \"scary as well as fun\".\n\nThis episode marked the end of the tradition of featuring humorous tombstones in the title sequence of Halloween episodes. The title sequence of this episode featured a tombstone reading \"Amusing Tombstones\", which was a sign that the writers could no longer devise ideas to use as humorous tombstone messages. Similar sequences were featured as introductions in all four preceding Treehouse of Horror episodes, but have not been featured since this episode.\n\nThe staff also decided against the traditional continuation of featuring wrap-around segments that were featured before each story in the preceding Treehouse of Horror episodes, to allow more time for the main stories.\n\nThe first segment, The Shinning, was inspired by the film The Shining, and is basically a parody of that film. The film's director, Stanley Kubrick, had been a big influence on Mirkin, and was \"one of the main reason[s] [he] wanted to be a director\". Coincidentally, series creator Matt Groening admitted that he had not seen The Shining and most of the references to the film were entirely lost on him.\n\nMatt Groening originally pitched the idea that Homer would travel through time in Time and Punishment. His original idea was that the time-travel would be the result of Homer simply jamming his hand in the toaster, but it was rejected by the other writers.\n\nThe first time Homer travels back in time, he was originally supposed to state \"I'm the first non-fictional character to travel backwards through time\". The line was later changed from \"non-fictional\" to \"non-Brazilian\". Groening was confused as to the reason for the change, since he liked the original so much. In fact, he did not even understand what the new line implied.\n\nIn the scene where the Simpsons' house transforms into numerous objects, one of the original designs included the house made entirely of squirrels. The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but ultimately it was cut. To ensure their work did not go to waste, some staff members have used the drawings on Christmas cards and other studio-related notices.\n\nIn another deleted scene involving an alternate Simpsons future, the Simpsons had a teenage son named Roy. Groening said that \"somebody from outside the show\" originally suggested the idea. The joke was later used as a sub-plot for the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\", although Roy was a lodger in that episode, rather than a son.\n\nNightmare Cafeteria was the first Simpsons story to be written by David X. Cohen. He wrote the final scene where a nightmarish fog turns the family \"inside out\". This was inspired by a thriller featured on the radio show Lights Out called \"The Dark\", which frightened Cohen as a child. A dance number was added immediately afterwards in order to end the show on a lighter note. He also cut two scenes from this segment featuring Sherri and Terri being cooked as \"Teriyaki\" steak with a \"Sherry\" sauce and Homer regaling Lisa about his dream of eating Milhouse. Regardless, a book from this scene was featured in this segment. As a result of this scene being cut, Homer does not appear in the third segment, something Cohen thought never happened before. The \"grade F meat\" joke was written by Cohen, inspired by David's cousin once seeing a box of hot dogs labeled \"grade C, approved for human consumption\".\n\nCultural references\nThe voiceover in the pre-title sequence is a reference to the 1963 television series The Outer Limits. The first segment, The Shinning, is a parody of the Stephen King novel The Shining and the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name. The basic plot of the segment is the same as the novel and there are also many references to specific moments from the film, such as the blood coming out of the elevator and Homer breaking through a door with an axe and yelling \"Here's Johnny!\". Additionally, Homer\u2019s line of \u201cnot a drop in the house\u201d as he looks into the refrigerator mirrors the exact same camera angle and words of Wallace in A Grand Day Out.\n\nThe title of the second segment, Time and Punishment, is a reference to the Fyodor Dostoyevsky novel Crime and Punishment and the plot, where Homer causes major changes in the future by killing animals in the past, is a parody of the Ray Bradbury short story \"A Sound of Thunder\". Peabody and Sherman, from the animated series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, make an appearance during Homer's time traveling sequence and when, as a side effect of Homer's antics in the past, Kang and Kodos' heads are unexpectedly replaced with those of Peabody and Sherman. The dinosaur scenes are reminiscent of Jurassic Park, and the floor morphing into a television screen is a reference to similar scenes in both Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Time Bandits.\n\nThe title of the third segment, Nightmare Cafeteria, is a reference to the television series Nightmare Cafe, while the plot bears reference to Soylent Green. The song over the end credits is based on the song \"One\" from the musical A Chorus Line, while the concept of the family being turned inside out by a mysterious fog comes from an episode of the radio show Lights Out called \"The Dark\".\n\nReception\nIn its original broadcast, \"Treehouse of Horror V\" finished 27th in ratings for the week of October 24\u201330, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 12.2, equivalent to approximately 11.6 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills 90210.\n\nSince airing, \"Treehouse of Horror V\" has received critical acclaim. Entertainment Weekly ranked this episode as the ninth best of the entire series; The Shinning segment was described as \"a parody [...] with such detail [and] comic timing\" and that it \"ranks with the great [...] spoofs of all time\", and the Time and Punishment segment as \"one of the most beautifully random moments in [The] Simpsons history\", but also said that the Nightmare Cafeteria segment \"doesn't shine as brilliantly\". It ranked fifth on AskMen.com's \"Top 10: Simpsons Episodes\" list. The list stated that the episode \"offers three completely different tales, [...] boasting a potent combination of wit and humor\" that, \"the laughs never end\", and that it \"does a great job of incorporating Halloween-themed stories with the standard Simpsons charm\". IGN called the episode \"the funniest Treehouse of Horror to date\". In 2006, they also named it the best episode of the sixth season. Adam Finley of the weblog TV Squad called it \"possibly one of the best Halloween episodes ever\". Michael Passman of Michigan Daily said the episode \"is largely regarded as the best, but a weak final third holds it back\". Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the sixth season and the fourth greatest episode of The Simpsons. Consequence of Sound called it \"a true benchmark of the series,\" ranking it the second greatest \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode of all time. In 2019, Time ranked the episode third in its list of 10 best Simpsons episodes picked by Simpsons experts.\n\nThe Shinning is particularly the highest-praised segment. As well as Entertainment Weekly's praise, IGN voted it first on their list of the best segments in the Treehouse of Horror series, with Time and Punishment coming fourth. It came ninth on the blog Noise to Signal's list of \"The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes\". Adam Finley of TV Squad opined that it \"could [...] be the best Treehouse of Horror segment ever\" and praised the opening of Time and Punishment. When putting together the perfect Treehouse of Horror episode, Passman of Michigan Daily included The Shinning as \"a shoo-in\". Empire named \"No TV And No Beer Make Homer Go Crazy\" the sixth best film parody in the show's history. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"Another fine entry to the Treehouse canon\". Vulture named The Shinning the best \"Treehouse of Horror\" segment ever, stating, \"When you can\u2019t think of the original without also thinking of the spoof. That\u2019s The Shining and 'The Shinning,' easily the best Treehouse segment of all time.\" \n\nJames Earl Jones' guest appearance in this episode, as well as in \"Treehouse of Horror\" and \"Das Bus\", was listed seventh on IGN's \"Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances\" list. Jones ranked 25th on AOL's list of their favorite 25 The Simpsons guest stars. Matt Groening said that this line is among his favorite lines in the show. David Mirkin said that Homer's line, \"Oh I wish, I wish I hadn't killed that fish\", is one of his favorites in the show, and that the alternate future in which the family are rich \"breaks [his] heart every time\". Homer's line \"close enough\" from Time and Punishment was later used in the Stargate SG-1 episode \"Moebius\". \n\nAlf Clausen's musical score for this episode received an Emmy Award nomination for \"Outstanding Dramatic Underscore\u00a0\u2014 Series\" in 1995.\n\nLegacy\nTime and Punishment was later referenced in DC Comics' Booster Gold comic book series, where Booster Gold explains the butterfly effect by referencing this episode.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror V\" at The Simpsons.com\n\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 6) episodes\nCategory:1994 American television episodes\nCategory:Television episodes about time travel\nCategory:Cannibalism in fiction\nCategory:Television episodes about nightmares\nCategory:Television episodes about ghosts\nCategory:Treehouse of Horror (series)\nCategory:Halloween television episodes\nCategory:Dystopian television episodes\nCategory:Science fiction comedy\nCategory:Television episodes written by David X.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 25, 2015.\n\nThe episode, like the other Treehouse of Horror episodes, comprises three self-contained segments. In \"Wanted: Dead, Then Alive\", Sideshow Bob finally murders Bart; in \"Homerzilla\", Homer plays the role of Godzilla and his American remake; and in \"Telepaths of Glory\", Lisa, Milhouse and Maggie receive telepathic powers. Showrunner Al Jean gave an interview about the episode in the month before it aired. Kelsey Grammer reprises his role as the guest voice of Sideshow Bob, and the opening musical sequence was animated by John Kricfalusi.\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror XXVI\" was watched by an audience of 6.75 million, the highest on Fox that night. Reception was mixed, with its perceived excess violence and lack of originality being criticized.\n\nPlot\nThe episode opens with a John Kricfalusi-animated couch gag where the Simpson children are trick-or-treating before being set upon by soul-hungry spirits with a monstrous Frank Grimes among them that skins Bart for his soul before Maggie saves him and Lisa. The spirits chase after the Simpson children to their home, and the Frank Grimes monster takes Homer's soul.\n\nWanted: Dead, Then Alive\nBart gets a text message from Milhouse, telling him to come to the music room. When he gets there, he finds Sideshow Bob, who lured him there with Milhouse's phone in order to accomplish his lifelong dream: to kill Bart. Bob kills Bart with a spear gun and takes his body to his house to celebrate his accomplishment. As his main objective in life is done, he decides to complete other dreams, such as becoming a literature teacher at Springfield University, but is dissatisfied as his students are lazy cheaters. He discovers that the only thing that has made him happy was hunting down Bart for 24 years, so he builds a machine to bring Bart back to life so he can kill him over and over. Bob's machine is discovered by Santa's Little Helper, and the Simpson family break into his basement and reanimate Bart. Bob appears with a shotgun and has the legal right to kill the intruding Simpsons. Homer attacks Bob with a lamp, ripping his head off, and Marge decides that Bart can keep Bob's remains. Bart puts Bob's head into the Reanimator with a horn, frog legs, a chicken body, a tail and a booger, making a bizarre-looking creature.\n\nHomerzilla\nIn a parody of Godzilla, a crazy old Japanese man based on Grampa Simpson is constantly mocked because every day he drops a perfect donut into the ocean. When asked why he does such things, he says that is because if he does not, a huge sea monster will rise and destroy the city. One day, as he is preparing a donut for his \"ritual\", he chokes on the toppings and dies. With nobody to drop the donuts, a sea monster called Homerzilla (Homer) wakes up and destroys the city. The scene cuts to the present time, where executives are watching the Homerzilla film, stating that it is so bad that it deserves a remake. Two years later, they release Zilla, a total failure. They throw all the merchandising into the ocean, but the containers wake up Homerzilla and a message appears reporting that he will return as soon as people have forgotten about the last film.\n\nTelepaths of Glory\nIn a parody of Chronicle, Bart, Lisa and Milhouse are walking through a forest. Bart scares Lisa with dead owls, and she hits Milhouse's nose with the camera, making him lose his balance and fall into a giant hole. Bart and Lisa decide to jump into the hole to rescue him, making all the three stuck inside of it with nuclear waste from the power plant. The radioactive goo explodes, sending all three of them back outside the hole. When they wake up, Milhouse and Lisa discover that they have gained telekinesis, so they decide to use the powers for selfish purposes. Lisa only makes a few changes, but Milhouse goes mad with powers only to be struck by lightning. Lisa says she did not do it, making the family curious to discover who did this. The camera pans to reveal that Maggie also has telepathic powers, as she was using a radioactive rod as a pacifier. Maggie then uses her powers to benefit the world, such as turning Homerzilla into a larger Barney the Dinosaur before taking a nap while still floating in the air. The episode ends with Kang and Kodos on their spaceship, with Kang complaining that once again, they only have made a cameo appearance, despite Kodos admonishing him against it; before the show's producers proceed to reduce the aspect ratio from 16:9 to 4:3, much to Kodos' horror. Kang then says indignantly \"Just 'cos it looks like season 4 doesn't make it season 4!\"\n\nProduction\n\nIn a September 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Al Jean spoke about the episode, saying: \"We're trying to break barriers and it's like nothing we've ever done. It's a bit of a very scary tribute to Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but updated. Then we have Sideshow Bob killing Bart. And if you wanted Bob to kill Bart, you're going to get your wish. I was always the kind of kid that wanted [Wile E.] Coyote to eat the Roadrunner, so this made me very happy\". He added that Bob's voice actor, Kelsey Grammer, was excited by the prospect, exclaiming \"Oh, finally!\"\n\nThe episode opens with a sequence animated by Ren & Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi, featuring a \"Grinch-esque song\" which \"sneaks in Kricfalusi\u2019s signature scatology while being quite catchy\". Bob chastises his students for using Wikipedia for their research on T. S. Eliot, lamenting that \"the author of Cats could be insulted further\". Elvis Costello's 1979 single \"Accidents Will Happen\" plays as Bob repeatedly murders Bart.\n\nReception\nThe episode received a 2.8 rating and was watched by a total of 6.75 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night.\n\nThe episode received mixed reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, calling it \"middling\". He wrote that the first segment \"just goes for the gore\" and that there was \"not much glee in the dark humor\"; though he did praise Bart's death montage and compared it to those of Emperor Joker and its Batman: The Brave and the Bold adaptation, he concluded that the segment \"is as repetitive as murdering your arch-enemy again and again and again.\" He was more favoring towards the satire in \"Homerzilla\", but concluded that it had \"not too much meat on [its] bones\", and decried the lack of originality in the final segment, although he approved of Principal Skinner correcting graffiti to call himself a \"wiener\".\n\nJesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode 6.9 out of 10, saying that it \"offers a decent lineup of darker Springfield adventures. The standout is the return of Sideshow Bob, a story entertaining enough it really deserved its own, full-length episode. \"Homerzilla\" also has its moments. And while the lack of originality in \"Telepaths of Glory\" is disappointing, as a whole this episode is entertaining enough to fall comfortably in the middle of the pack as far as \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes go.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:2015 American television episodes\nCategory:Halloween television episodes\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 27) episodes\nCategory:Treehouse of Horror (series)\nCategory:Godzilla\nCategory:Television episodes about telepathy\nCategory:Television episodes about murder\nCategory:Television episodes about telekinesis\nCategory:Television episodes about revenge\nCategory:Television episodes about resurrection\n"}, {"id": "BkksMIbxK1TjZJ7cqtYY", "content": "Halloween of Horror\n\n\"Halloween of Horror\" is the fourth episode of the twenty-seventh season of the animated television series The Simpsons, and the 578th episode of the series overall. It originally aired in the United States on Fox on October 18, 2015.\n\nIt is the first Halloween-themed episode of The Simpsons to be fully canon and the only one to date that is not part of the show\u2019s Treehouse of Horror series. \n\nThe episode received highly positive reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\nThe day before Halloween, the Simpson family completely decorates their house, calling it \"Everscream Terrors\". Homer stores the plastic skeletons too close to the furnace, and he decides to take the remains to Grampa's home and buy something new at the Halloween pop-up store. On their way to the store, Lisa and Bart see a sign advertising the upcoming Krustyland Halloween Horror Night, and share their excitement for it. At the Halloween shop, Apu gets angry at three lazy employees who are sleeping on their jobs, telling them to go back to work. While Homer is looking for a decoration to replace the skeletons, one of the workers gives Homer a deal where if he buys one \"Se\u00f1or Skeleton\", he will give Homer a set of four of them for free. Homer accepts the deal and tells Apu about it, who promptly fires the workers. The three then vow revenge on Homer.\n\nLater, Homer takes the children to the Halloween Horror Night. Although the Horror Night is not real, Lisa gets scared by the zombies and the park is closed. At school, Lisa's trauma makes her scared from even the simplest Halloween figures such as paper zombies and bats. She then hides inside a locker only to be rescued later by Marge. Back home, Marge tells Homer they should shut down Everscream Terrors for Lisa's sake, making both Homer and Bart upset. As Marge takes Bart and Maggie to the most famous Halloween block party at a cul-de-sac in Springfield, Homer tries to bond with Lisa offering to do a puzzle with her at home. At the same time, the three workers that Homer inadvertently got fired have come for their revenge, and begin to stalk Homer and Lisa.\n\nHomer locks up the house to protect them from the three men; however, they are already inside the house. He tries to take Lisa to the Flanders' house, but she runs back inside to get Tailee, a fur tail from Lisa's early childhood that brought her comfort. Homer rushes to save her, only for them to wind up face-to-face with the home invaders. Homer and Lisa run up the stairs and hide in the attic, and the invaders are unable to find them.\n\nMarge arrives at the block party with Bart and Maggie, but they are told by the security guard the party is for residents only after visitors wrecked last year's party. After unsuccessfully trying to bribe the security guard into letting them in, Marge tries to take Bart and Maggie trick-or-treating, but it is late out and all the children are asleep. The adults of Springfield come out in their mostly suggestive costumes and a musical number about adult Halloween follows (the musical number, \"NC-17 Halloween\", is a parody of the Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Picture Show).\n\nAt the Simpsons' house, Homer is able to calm down Lisa and they decide to use their various holiday decorations to signal for help, but they accidentally activate the Se\u00f1or Skeletons, giving away their hiding location to the three men. Homer climbs onto the roof to light up the 4th of July fireworks, but the strong wind extinguishes the matches. Lisa then remembers that Tailee is made of polyester and will burn easily, so Lisa decides to sacrifice Tailee and light the fireworks to attract people's attention. This plan is a success, and the whole neighborhood wakes up. The home invaders are then arrested by the police almost immediately and Homer rebuilds Everscream Terrors so the whole town can enjoy it as Lenny and Carl arrive dressed as Kang and Kodos. Lisa, now unafraid of the decorations, also joins in the fun, and manages to scare Marge just as she arrives with Bart and Maggie.\n\nDuring the end credits, Maggie finds the half-burnt Tailee which magically restores itself to the tune of John Carpenter's Halloween.\n\nReception\nThe episode received a 1.7 rating and was watched by a total of 3.69 million people, making it the most watched show on Fox that night.\n\nDennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, stating \"An impeccably directed, character-driven story about children\u2019s fears and grown-up responsibility, the episode, credited to writer Carolyn Omine, is one of the most assured, human, and outright best Simpsons episodes in years.\"\n\nThe episode received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Animated Program. Additionally, Carolyn Omine was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 68th Writers Guild of America Awards for her script to this episode.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:2015 American television episodes\nCategory:Halloween television episodes\nCategory:The Simpsons (season 27) episodes\n"}, {"id": "BkksMXHxK6Etr6O4yyog", "content": "Treehouse of Horror\n\nTreehouse of Horror, also known as The Simpsons Halloween specials''', are a series of Halloween-themed episodes of the animated series The Simpsons, each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the Simpson family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting. They take place outside the show's normal continuity and completely abandon any pretense of being realistic, being known for their far more violent and much darker nature than an average Simpsons episode.  The first, entitled \"Treehouse of Horror\", aired on October 25, 1990, as part of the second season and was inspired by EC Comics horror tales. Since then, there have been 29 other Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year.\n\nEpisodes contain parodies of horror, science fiction, and fantasy films, as well as the alien characters Kang and Kodos, a special version of the opening sequence, and scary names in the credits. The show's staff regard the Treehouse of Horror as being particularly difficult to produce, as the scripts often go through many rewrites, and the animators typically have to design new characters and backgrounds.\n\nMany of the episodes are popular among fans and critics of the show and have inspired a whole offshoot of Simpsons merchandise, including action figures, playsets, video games, books, DVDs, comic books, and a special version of Monopoly. Several of the episodes have won awards for animation and sound editing. In 1996, 2013, and 2015, \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", \"Treehouse of Horror XXIII\", and \"Treehouse of Horror XXV\" were respectively nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\" category.\n\nSegmentsTreehouse of Horror episodes typically consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed version of the credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, Twilight Zone episodes, or old issues of EC Comics. Although they are sometimes connected by \"wraparounds\", the three segments rarely have any kind of continuing connection within the episode. The two exceptions are \"Treehouse of Horror V\", in which Groundskeeper Willie is killed by an axe in a similar fashion in all three segments, as well as in Treehouse of Horror XXVIII, in which Maggie is possessed by the demon Pazuzu in the first segment and is still recovering in the next segment. The episodes are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show, since each character appears to be fine afterwards.\n\nFrom \"Treehouse of Horror\" to \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", all three segments were written by different writers. In some cases there was a fourth writer who wrote the opening and wraparound segments. For the original \"Treehouse of Horror\", there were three different directors for the episode. Starting with season 15's \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\", however, only one writer has been credited with writing each Treehouse of Horror episode.\n\nOn occasion, the episodes will be used to showcase special animation, such as the \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" segment \"Homer3\", in which a computer-animated Homer is shown in a non-animated setting. At the time (1995), it was groundbreaking, as it was unusual for a television show to use such animation. The segment was executive producer Bill Oakley's idea and included live action directed by David Mirkin. \"Treehouse of Horror XX\" included the segment \"There's No Business Like Moe Business\", which was the first to be musically-themed.\n\nTraditions\n\nOpening sequence\n\nEvery Treehouse of Horror episode opens with a special introductory segment. The first, second, and fifth Treehouse of Horror episodes open with Marge standing on a stage and warning parents about the content of the episode, advising them to put their children to bed. The warning in the first episode was put in as a sincere effort to warn young viewers, as the producers felt it was somewhat scary. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film Frankenstein. Marge's warnings quickly became a burden to write. After \"Treehouse of Horror V\", they were permanently dropped, and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them.\n\nOther Treehouse of Horror episodes have opened with parodies; for example, \"Treehouse of Horror III\" had Homer introduce the episode in a manner similar to Alfred Hitchcock in Alfred Hitchcock Presents, \"Treehouse of Horror IV\" had Bart introduce the episode and segments in a manner similar to Night Gallery, and \"Treehouse of Horror V\" featured a parody of The Outer Limits. The sixth and seventh episodes featured short clips with no lines because the episodes had run long, and longer segments were cut. Following \"Treehouse of Horror VII\", the opening has been upwards of a minute long and sometimes featured an introduction by a character, such as Mr. Burns in \"Treehouse of Horror XVII\" or included over-the-top violence, such as \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" (which showed a Fox Network censor named Fox Censor being brutally murdered) and \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\" (which showed the Simpson family killing each other).\n\nIn the opening segment of the first five episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous season, deceased celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison, and a tombstone with an inscription that read \"TV violence\" that was riddled with bullets as the camera panned on it. They were last used in \"Treehouse of Horror V\", which included a solitary tombstone with the words \"Amusing Tombstones\" to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Another reason they were dropped was that the tombstones would list television shows that had been canceled the previous season; after a few years, several of the shows that were canceled were produced by former Simpsons writers. However, after two decades, this gag made a brief comeback in Treehouse of Horror XXIX at the very beginning, this time appearing before the main opening sequence and title.\n\nWhile the early Treehouse of Horror episodes featured a Halloween themed opening sequence, the later ones only included the title and the \"created by\" and \"developed by\" credits. Every episode between \"Treehouse of Horror III\" and \"Treehouse of Horror X\" featured a couch gag with a Halloween theme, including the Simpson family dressed as skeletons, zombies, and characters from previous Halloween episodes.\n\nWraparounds\nThe first four Treehouse of Horror episodes had brief wraparounds that occurred before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories. \"Treehouse of Horror\" was the only one that actually included a treehouse as a setting. In that episode, Bart and Lisa sat in it telling stories to each other. \"Treehouse of Horror II\" presented all of the segments as being nightmares of Lisa, Bart and Homer; \"Treehouse of Horror III\" had Lisa, Bart and Grampa telling stories at a Halloween party; and \"Treehouse of Horror IV\" is presented by Bart in a parody of Rod Serling's Night Gallery. After a few years, the amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened, allowing less time to tell a proper story. There were no wraparounds for \"Treehouse of Horror V\" because they had been cut to make more time for the segments. Following that, the writers permanently dropped them.\n\nKang and Kodos\n\nTwo characters that are virtually exclusive to the Treehouse of Horror series are Kang and Kodos, a pair of large green space aliens who were introduced in the \"Hungry are the Damned\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror\". Kang and Kodos have since appeared in every Treehouse of Horror episode, sometimes as important parts of a story, but often just for brief cameos. In some episodes, they only appear in the opening segment, but often they will make a cameo appearance in the middle of a different story. For example, a story about zombies attacking the town briefly cuts to them in their space ship, watching the events and laughing maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering. The action then switches back to the actual story. The unofficial rule is that they must be in every episode, although quite often they will be forgotten and are added at the last moment, resulting in only a brief appearance. Their scene in \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" nearly did not make the final cut of the episode, but David X. Cohen managed to persuade the producers to leave the scene in.\n\nKang and Kodos were prominent characters in the 2015 episode \"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner,\" which was not Halloween themed.\n\nScary names\n\nBeginning with \"Treehouse of Horror II\", the producers decided to give the cast and crew of the show \"scary names\" in the opening and closing credits. Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there have been a wide variety of special credits, from simple names like \"Bat Groening\" to complex ones like \"David\u00b2+S.\u00b2=Cohen\u00b2\". Sam Simon, who left the show during the fourth season but still receives \"developed by\" and \"executive producer\" credits, and until Treehouse of Horror XXVI, he had been listed in Treehouse of Horror episodes as \"Sam 'Sayonara' Simon\".  Since his death in 2015, he has been credited simply by his real name.\n\nThe idea for \"scary names\" came from executive producer Al Jean, who was inspired by EC Comics because some of the issues also used \"scary\" alternate names. The \"scary names\" became such a burden to write that they were cut for \"Treehouse of Horror XII\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back. Matt Groening's rule for the \"scary names\" is that they cannot be longer than a person's real name, but this is rarely followed by anyone else.\n\nCultural references\nReferences to films, novels, plays, television shows, and other media are commonly featured, and many segments have been parodies of a specific work in the horror, science fiction, or fantasy genre. Many segments are spoofs of episodes of The Twilight Zone, and entire segments will be based on a single episode. Some of the Twilight Zone episodes parodied include \"A Kind of a Stopwatch\", \"To Serve Man\", \"A Small Talent for War\", \"Living Doll\", \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", \"Little Girl Lost\", and \"The Little People\". The \"Bart's Nightmare\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror II\" parodies the episode \"It's a Good Life\" and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of The Twilight Zone. The Halloween episodes also regularly parody horror and thriller films such as The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, King Kong, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fly, Psycho, Paranormal Activity, and Dead Calm. Robert Englund, who portrays Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm street franchise, had a cameo appearance in \"Treehouse of Horror IX\" as the character. Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes, many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror. Science fiction works parodied include The Omega Man, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. In \"Treehouse of Horror\", Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\" is read by James Earl Jones, while the parts are acted by various characters. Recent parodies have included films and television specials in more varied genres, including Mr. & Mrs. Smith, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Transformers, Sweeney Todd, the Twilight film series, and Jumanji.\n\nGracie Films logo\nA modified version of the production logo for Gracie Films is displayed after the closing credits. The shushing sound is replaced by a scream (for the most part), and the jingle is played in a minor key on a pipe organ. Earlier episodes did not feature the scream.\n\nProduction\n\nThe first Treehouse of Horror installment aired in 1990 as part of the second season, and its on-screen title was \"The Simpsons Halloween Special.\" It was inspired by EC Comics Horror tales. Although every episode is entitled Treehouse of Horror, the first was the only episode that actually used the treehouse motif. During production of the first episode, Matt Groening was nervous about \"The Raven\" segment, and felt it would be \"the worst, most pretentious thing [they had] ever done.\"\n\nThe Treehouse of Horror episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators. The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run, but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers, giving the animators more time to work. Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds, new characters and new designs. They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories, an opening and, in the early episodes, a wraparound. They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20\u201322\u00a0minute episode. The episodes often go through many last minute changes, with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded. \"Treehouse of Horror III\" in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six-week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode. By the fourth season, executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss were less enamored of Treehouse of Horror episodes and considered dropping them, but the other writers insisted that they be kept.\n\nPart of the attraction for the writers is that they are able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will have an idea that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but can be used as a segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. Treehouse of Horror V has been described by Mirkin as being one of \"the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever\" as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier installments began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that \"if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow.\" However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it \"a societal thing\". He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, \"[in] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower.\"\n\nAlthough gruesome for the most part, some segments, such as \"Citizen Kang\" in Treehouse of Horror VII, satirize political issues. The opening segment of Treehouse of Horror XIX featured Homer attempting to vote for Barack Obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for John McCain. Rather than taking sides in the election, Jean says it is \"mostly a comment on what many people to believe to be the irregularities in our voting system.[sic]\" In Treehouse of Horror XVII, a segment called \"The Day the Earth Looked Stupid\" ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called \"Operation: Enduring occupation\". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say \"This sure is a lot like Iraq will be.\" The Fox network did not have any objection to the line, but it was rejected by some of the writers as too obvious and was cut from broadcast. While cut from the aired version, the line does appear in the \"review\" version sent to newspapers and magazines.\n\nThe first Treehouse of Horror episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally, it was intended to use a theremin, but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes. Usually when the producers submit an episode for the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)\", they submit a Treehouse of Horror episode, and to date, seven episodes have been nominated. The closing of IV features a version of the theme that is a combination of the instruments used in The Munsters theme song and the harpiscord and clicking from the Addams Family theme song.\n\n\u00dcter Z\u00f6rker is so far the only human character introduced in a Treehouse of Horror to make it into canon. His debut episode was \"Treehouse of Horror IV\" in the segment \"Terror at  Feet\". He is an obese German exchange student obsessed with candy and is voiced by Russi Taylor.\n\nJean revealed that 2019's Treehouse of Horror will be the 666th episode of the series. Jean stated that this was planned ever since the beginning in 1989.\n\nScheduling\n\nAlthough Treehouse of Horror episodes are Halloween-themed, for several years new episodes premiered in November following the holiday, due to Fox's coverage of Major League Baseball's World Series. Season 12's \"Treehouse of Horror XI\" was the first episode to air in November. There have been several references to this in the show, such as in \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\" where Kang looks at a TV Guide and says, \"Pathetic humans. They're showing a Halloween episode... in November!\" and Kodos replies \"Who's still thinking about Halloween? We've already got our Christmas decoration up.\" The camera then cuts to a shot of the fireplace with Christmas decorations, and festive Christmas music plays over the opening credits. Season 21's \"Treehouse of Horror XX\" aired October 18, before the World Series, but the following year's episode, \"Treehouse of Horror XXI\", aired in November. Season 23's \"Treehouse of Horror XXII aired on October 30, however, as the World Series (which went the maximum of seven games) had concluded on October 28. Subsequent Treehouse of Horror episodes have premiered in the month of October. The 31st season included a Thanksgiving-themed spinoff, \"Thanksgiving of Horror\".\n\nMerchandise\nThere has been a variety of merchandise based on the Treehouse of Horror episodes, including books, action figures, comic books, video games, DVDs and a \"Treehouse of Horror\" version of Hasbro's board game Monopoly. Although every Treehouse of Horror episode until \"Treehouse of Horror XVI\" has been released along with its season in a boxset, in 2003, The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror DVD was released. It includes Treehouse of Horrors V, VI, VII and XII. A Treehouse of Horror comic book has been published annually since 1995, and collected into several books, including The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Fun-Filled Frightfest, Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror Spine-Tingling Spooktacular, Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror Heebie-Jeebie Hullabaloo and The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Hoodoo Voodoo Brouhaha. Several video games based on The Simpsons include levels with a Halloween theme, including The Simpsons: Hit & Run and The Simpsons Game. In 2001, Fox Interactive and THQ released The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror on Game Boy Color. The entire game has a Halloween theme as the player tries to save the Simpson family from the Treehouse of Horror.\n\nMany of the special character designs featured in the episodes have become action figures. Four different playsets have been made by Playmates Toys and released as Toys \"R\" Us exclusives. The sets are:\n\nThe \"Treehouse of Horror I\" set was released in 2000 and included a cemetery playset as well as \"Devil Flanders\", \"Bart the Fly\", \"Vampire Burns\", and \"King Homer\". It also came with an \"Evil Krusty Doll\" and Gremlin as accessories.\nThe \"Treehouse of Horror 2\" set was released in 2001 and included an interior alien spaceship playset as well as Kang, Kodos and \"Alien Ship Homer\". The entire set was based on \"Treehouse of Horror\".\nThe \"Treehouse of Horror 3\" set was released in 2002 and included a playset based on the \"Ironic Punishment Division\" of Hell in \"Treehouse of Horror IV\". It came with \"Donuthead Homer\", \"Witch Marge\", Hugo Simpson and \"Dream Invader Willie\".\nThe final \"Treehouse of Horror 4\" set was released in 2003 and included a playset based on Comic Book Guy's \"Collector's all-plastic lair\". It came with \"The Collector\", \"Clobber Girl Lisa\", \"Stretch Dude Bart\" and Lucy Lawless. All the designs were based on \"Treehouse of Horror X\".\nOn 2019, Funko revealed a 2-pack Kang and Kodos vinyl figure set presented as an exclusive for San Diego Comic Con 2019, along with a Treehouse of Horror Pop! wave, including King Homer (Treehouse of Horror III), Fly Bart (Treehouse of Horror VIII), Cat Marge (Treehouse of Horror XIII), Demon Lisa (Treehouse of Horror XXV), and Alien Maggie (Treehouse of Horror IX).\n\nAfter the Playmates Toys sets were finished, McFarlane Toys produced four Treehouse of Horror themed playsets including the \"Ironic Punishment Box Set\" released in 2004, the \"In the Belly of the Boss\u00a0\u2014 Homer & Marge Action Figures\" released in 2005, \"The Island of Dr. Hibbert Box Set\" released in 2006, and a \"Lard Lad Box Set\" released in 2007.\n\nReception\nThe Treehouse of Horror episodes are often among the top-rated episodes of their seasons and many of the Treehouse of Horrors have generally been well-received by fans. However, like The Simpsons itself, critics have noted a decline in the quality of the later episodes. In its first airing, \"Treehouse of Horror\" finished with a 15.7 Nielsen rating and a 25% audience share and would lose to The Cosby Show. It was said that it \"set a level of excellence that viewers never expected creator Matt Groening to repeat\", although it was also described as \"kind of stupid and unsatisfying\". \"Treehouse of Horror V\" is considered the best episode by several critics: it finished ninth on Entertainment Weeklys top 25 The Simpsons episode list, fifth on AskMen.com's \"Top 10: Simpsons Episodes\" list, and was named best episode of the sixth season by IGN.com. In 2006, James Earl Jones, who guest starred in \"Treehouse of Horror\" and \"Treehouse of Horror V\", was named seventh on IGN's \"Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances\" list.\n\nIn 2006, IGN.com published a list of the top ten Treehouse of Horror segments, and they placed \"The Shinning\" from \"Treehouse of Horror V\" at the top, saying it was \"not only a standout installment of the annual Halloween episode, but of The Simpsons, period.\" Rounding out the list were \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\", \"The Devil and Homer Simpson\", \"Time and Punishment\", \"Hungry Are the Damned\", \"Clown Without Pity\", \"Citizen Kang\", \"If I Only Had a Brain\", \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\", and \"Starship Poopers\". The third, fourth, and fifth episodes were each represented by two segments. The most recent episode on the list was \"Treehouse of Horror IX\", which first aired in 1998.\n\n\"Treehouse of Horror VII\" is Simpsons creator Matt Groening's seventh favorite episode, and the line he likes best is \"We have reached the limit of what rectal probing can teach us.\" \"King Homer\" of \"Treehouse of Horror III\" is one of Matt Groening's favorite segments. \"Treehouse of Horror III\" is also noted for the moment where Homer shoots Ned Flanders and Bart says \"Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders!\" only for Homer to reply, \"He was a zombie?\" It is also one of Groening's favorite lines.\n\nAwards\n\nIn 1996, the \"Homer\u00b3\" segment of \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" was awarded the Ottawa International Animation Festival grand prize. In 1998, \"Treehouse of Horror VIII\" won a Golden Reel Award for \"Best Sound Editing \u2013 Television Animated Specials\"; the recipients were Robert Mackston, Travis Powers, Norm MacLeod, and Terry Greene. Bob Beecher also received a nomination for \"Best Sound Editing in Television Animation \u2013 Music\" for \"Treehouse of Horror X\".\n\nThe second, third, fifth, eighth, ninth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth Treehouse of Horror episodes were nominated for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)\" at the Primetime Emmy Awards. The second and third \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes were also nominated for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special\". In 1996, \"Treehouse of Horror VI\" was submitted for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)\" category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which the staff felt would have given it the edge. The episode failed to win, and Bill Oakley later expressed regret about submitting the episode. The twenty-third and twenty-fifth Treehouse of Horror episodes were nominated for the same award in 2013 and 2015 respectively.\n\nSee also\n\n \"Halloween of Horror\"\n \"Thanksgiving of Horror\"\n List of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\"Treehouse of Horror\" 101, About.com''\n\n \nCategory:1990 introductions\nCategory:American annual television specials\nCategory:Black comedy\nCategory:Halloween television specials\nCategory:The Simpsons\n"}, {"id": "BkksLWnxK0yhTepmlUrV", "content": "List of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes\n\nThis is a list of Treehouse of Horror episodes produced by the animated television series The Simpsons. Treehouse of Horror episodes have aired annually since the second season (1990) and each episode has three separate segments. These segments usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and are therefore considered to be non-canon. The original \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode aired on October 25, 1990 and was inspired by EC Comics Horror tales. Before \"Treehouse of Horror XI\", which aired in 2000, every episode has aired in the week preceding or on October 31; \"Treehouse of Horror II\" and \"Treehouse of Horror X\" are the only two episodes to air on Halloween. Between 2000 to 2008 and 2010, due to Fox's contract with Major League Baseball's World Series, episodes had originally aired in November; as of 2011 every Treehouse of Horror episode has aired in October. From \"Treehouse of Horror\" to \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", all three segments were written by different writers and in some cases there was a fourth writer that wrote the opening and wraparound segments. For \"Treehouse of Horror\", there were even three different directors for the episode. Starting with season fifteen's \"Treehouse of Horror XIV\", only one writer was credited as having written a Treehouse of Horror episode, and the trend has continued since.\n\nAs of 2019, there are thirty Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. The 31st season included a Thanksgiving-themed spinoff, \"Thanksgiving of Horror\". They are known for being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several different trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. Quite often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often, and has served as the inspiration for numerous segments.\n\nEpisodes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n Official episode guide at the Fox website TheSimpsons.com.

Following a commitment from 20th Century Fox Television to produce four straight-to-DVD Futurama films, Comedy Central announced on June 23, 2006 that they were resurrecting the show and would air the films as new Futurama episodes (reconfiguring each film into four episodes) after each film's DVD release. Comedy Central began airing Futurama reruns in January 2008 and broadcast the first film on March 23, 2008. Following the four films (considered the fifth season of the show), Comedy Central has broadcast a sixth season of twenty-six episodes, split over 2010 and 2011. A seventh season was announced in March 2011 and debuted in the summer of 2012.\n\nThe original 72-episode run of Futurama was produced as four seasons; Fox broadcast the episodes out of the intended order, resulting in five aired seasons.

Other establishing shots and advertisements are interspersed throughout the episode.\n\nFuturama: The Lost Adventure\n\nThe Futurama video game was released shortly after the airing of the 72nd episode in August 2003. The game's story and dialogue was written by J. Stewart Burns, and the voice direction was by David X. Cohen. According to Cohen, the half-hour's worth of cutscenes in the game were originally written as \"the 73rd episode of the original series.\" These cutscenes were compiled together (along with footage of the video game being played) and released as a bonus feature on the DVD release of The Beast with a Billion Backs. Renamed Futurama: The Lost Adventure, the episode tells of how the Planet Express crew prevented Mom from using Earth to take over the Universe.\n\nFuturama Live!\n\nFuturama Live! first aired on July 11, 2012 on Comedy Central following the original broadcast of the episode \"Zapp Dingbat\", the public were given the chance to participate in a live chat with the Futurama cast and crew. Several previews of then-upcoming Season 7 episodes were shown during the live stream, and several details about the season were revealed, including: returning appearances by the characters Guenter and Dr. Banjo in an episode of broadcast season 10, the debut of Lrrr's son, an episode about the origins of Scruffy, a three-part episode featuring 1980s-style animation, the status of Mars, and the possibility of \"M\u00f6bius strip clubs\". One lucky fan even won a prize.\n\nA second episode of Futurama Live! was aired as a live Internet webcast event broadcast on September 4, 2013 on the Comedy Central website and the Nerdist YouTube channel as part of the Futurama series finale. It was broadcast in two parts, the first part was the pre-show hosted by Chris Hardwick and featured Futurama creator Matt Groening, series showrunner David X.

While the films were originally released between November 27, 2007 and February 24, 2009, the TV edits began airing on March 23, 2008 and concluded after 16 episodes on August 30, 2009. These episodes were the first produced for Comedy Central, after their negotiations with Fox for syndication rights gave the opportunity to create new episodes.\n\nProduction\nFuturama was initially cancelled by Fox, in 2003, due to low ratings. However, in late 2002, Cartoon Network acquired exclusive cable syndication rights to Futurama for a reported $10 million. In January 2003, the network began airing Futurama episodes as the centerpiece to the expansion of their Adult Swim cartoon block. In October 2005, Comedy Central picked up the cable syndication rights to air Futuramas 72-episode run at the start of 2008, following the expiration of Cartoon Network's contract. It was cited as the largest and most expensive acquisition in the network's history. In 2005, it began airing every night, followed by South Park. A Comedy Central teaser trailer announced the return of Futurama March 23, 2008, which was Bender's Big Score divided into four episodes followed by the other three movies. The series also airs in syndication in many countries around the world.\n\nWhen Comedy Central began negotiating for the rights to air Futurama reruns, Fox suggested that there was a possibility of also creating new episodes. Negotiations were already underway with the possibility of creating two or three straight-to-DVD films. When Comedy Central committed to sixteen new episodes, it was decided that four films would be produced. On April 26, 2006, Groening noted in an interview that co-creator David X. Cohen and numerous writers from the original series would be returning to work on the movies. All the original voice actors participated. In February 2007, Groening explained the format of the new stories: \"[The crew is] writing them as movies and then we're going to chop them up, reconfigure them, write new material and try to make them work as separate episodes.\"\n\nThe first movie, Futurama: Bender's Big Score, was written by Ken Keeler and Cohen, and includes return appearances by the Nibblonians, Seymour, Barbados Slim, Robot Santa, the \"God\" space entity, Al Gore, and Zapp Brannigan. It was animated in widescreen and was released on standard DVD on November 27, 2007, with a possible Blu-ray Disc release to follow. A release on HD DVD was rumored but later officially denied. Futurama: Bender's Big Score was the first DVD release for which 20th Century Fox implemented measures intended to reduce the total carbon footprint of the production, manufacturing, and distribution processes. Where it was not possible to completely eliminate carbon output, carbon offsets were used. They refer to the changed processes as \"carbon neutral\".\n\nThe second movie, The Beast with a Billion Backs, was released on June 24, 2008. The third movie, Bender's Game was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 3, 2008 in the UK, November 4, 2008 in the USA, and December 10, 2008 in Australia. The fourth movie, Into the Wild Green Yonder, was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 23, 2009.\n\nSince no new Futurama projects were originally in production at the time, the movie Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the Futurama series finale. However, Groening had expressed a desire to continue the franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film.

The season marks the change of networks from Fox to Comedy Central.\n\nThe first 13 episodes (known as Season 6-A) aired during 2010, and the remaining 13 episodes (known as Season 6-B) aired during 2011. This makes the episode \"The Futurama Holiday Spectacular\" the mid-season finale, despite airing almost twelve weeks after Futurama 100th episode. The final episode of the season, \"Reincarnation\", aired on September 8, 2011 as a three-segment non-canonical special after the official season finale.\n\nThe first 13 episodes of the season have been released on a box set called Futurama: Volume 5, on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. It was released in the United States and Canada, on December 21, 2010, and on UK DVD on boxing day 2011. The remaining 13 episodes are available on a box set called Futurama: Volume 6, which was released in the United States and Canada on December 20, 2011. Both volumes have all episodes ordered in production order as was the case with Volumes 1\u20134.\n\nProduction\nWith the future of the series uncertain at the time of production, the final of the four film releases Into the Wild Green Yonder was designed to stand as the final episode of the Futurama series. However, both Matt Groening and David X. Cohen had expressed a desire to continue the franchise in some form, including as a theatrical film. In an interview with CNN, Groening said that \"we have a great relationship with Comedy Central and we would love to do more episodes for them, but I don't know... We're having discussions and there is some enthusiasm but I can't tell if it's just me.\"\n\nOn June 9, 2009, 20th Century Fox announced that Comedy Central had picked up the show for 26 new half-hour episodes that began airing on June 24, 2010. Due to budget concessions, the number of returning writing staff had to be reduced.\nInitial voice actor contract talks resulted in a dispute, with 20th Century Fox reportedly refusing to meet the cast's demands for $75,000 per episode. The claim was strenuously denied by members of the cast, and on July 17, 2009 Fox announced that auditions would be held to recast the characters. Groening and Cohen had no part in the discussions, with the former stating \"we hope that Fox and the actors can come to an agreement as soon as possible.\" It was speculated by some in the media that this was merely a ploy in order to get the cast to agree to Fox's offer, citing a similar situation with the cast of The Simpsons as a previous example. The dispute resulted in the voice cast being unable to attend the Futurama booth at Comic Con 2009. However, a deal was struck and on July 31, 2009, it was announced that the full original voice cast would be returning.\n\nGroening, Cohen and the cast expressed extreme optimism for the return of Futurama, with Katey Sagal and Phil LaMarr claiming that the new season's episodes are \"hysterical\" and \"the best yet\". Commenting on the revival, Groening revealed that several plots for the upcoming episodes had actually been devised during or even before the original run of the series. Groening has also explained that he had been inspired by J. J. Abrams' Star Trek film, and had even considered rebooting Futurama, before opting for a \"rebirth\".\n\n\"Overclockwise\" was originally written to serve as an open-ended series finale, much in the way that the season 4 episode \"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\" and the film Into the Wild Green Yonder were produced, in case the show did not get renewed. It was eventually announced on March 24, 2011, that the show was renewed by Comedy Central for a seventh production season.\n\nEpisodes \n\nComedy Central chose to air the second half of this season out of the intended production order.

He had six sons, who were well-known landscape painters as well. Williams is considered the patriarch of the Williams family of painters, which is also referred to as the Barnes School.\n\nBiography\n\nLife and career\nAlthough 1782 is usually given for his birth date, Edward Williams was actually born in 1781 in London, and baptized 13 October 1781 at St. Mary's Church in the Lambeth district. His mother Mary Ward was a sister of James Ward, the well-known animal painter, and a sister of the equally well-known engraver William Ward. She was also a sister-in-law of the brilliant figure painter George Morland, and a sister-in-law of Henry Chalon, another animal painter. His father, also named Edward Williams, was an engraver who worked with the master mezzotint engraver John Raphael Smith, and ran with a notorious group of drinkers that included the aforementioned George Morland, and Thomas Rowlandson the caricaturist. As such, the younger Williams grew up surrounded by artists, of whom Ward and Moreland were two the best-known painters in Georgian London.\n\nEdward Williams, junior was sent around 1792 or 1793 to live with his maternal uncle James Ward, R.A. (1769\u20131859), but it seems unlikely that he received any painting instruction from him. Instead he was informally apprenticed to a carver and gilder named Thomas Hillier, who had a shop on Carnaby Street. Ultimately young Williams did become a painter, yet not a figure painter like his uncles, but a landscape painter, which, given his heritage is surprising as this was an age when landscape artists were considered inferior to figure painters. Although he never attained the fame of his uncles, he was nonetheless successful enough to enjoy a comfortable living. More important though, he fathered six sons, all artists like himself, who carried on the styles of landscape painting that he taught them, and some of whom were among the most popular landscape artists of the Victorian era.\n\nMost of Edward Williams' life was spent in or near the artists quarter associated with Tottenham Court Road in London, until 1846 when he moved his family to 32 Castelnau Villas in rural Barnes, Surrey. There he, his wife, three of their children, and some of their grandchildren shared a large house, with a carriage house in back that became their studio. Three of his older sons eventually moved to nearby houses, some virtually next door, with only his oldest son Edward Charles Williams remaining in London. Here in Barnes, close to marshes of the Thames River, and near farm fields and wooded estates, the Williams family lived and worked in a communal artist setting. The hundreds of skillfully painted landscapes, all similar in subject and style, that flowed from their Barnes studios under the tutelage of Edward Williams gave rise to the popular attribution of the \"Barnes School\" of artists. However, they are most commonly referred to more simply as the \"Williams family of painters\".\n\nEdward Williams between 1814 and 1855 exhibited at the Royal Academy (36 works), the British Institution (21 works), the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (38 works), and elsewhere. He often shared venues with his sons, causing some confusion with the public who had trouble telling one Williams painting from another. He is often called \"Old Williams\" to distinguish him from his oldest son, and he is referred to in some of the art journals of the time as \"Moonight Williams\", as moonlit scenes of the Thames were one of his favorite subjects in his paintings. He was predeceased by his wife, and he is said to have never quite overcome the grief at her death. He died on 24 June 1855 at the Castelnau Villas, and is buried nearby in Barnes Cemetery.\n\nFamily\nEdward Williams was the son of the engraver Edward Williams (c.1755-1797?) and Mary Ward. He married Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851) on 12 February 1806 in St Pancras, London, Ann being the daughter of Frederick and Sarah Hildebrandt. They had the eight children who follow. Three of Edward and Ann Williams' sons eventually changed their last name so that the public would not confuse their paintings with those of the rest of the family.\n\nEdward Charles Williams (10 July 1807 \u2013 25 July 1881 Shepherds Bush, London)\nHenry John Boddington Williams (1811, St Marylebone, London - 11 April 1865 Barnes, London)\nGeorge Augustus Williams (4 May 1814, St Marylebone, London - 26 May 1901, Barnes, London)\nArthur Gilbert Frederick Williams (19 December 1819, Newington Butts Road, Stoke Newington, London - 21 April 1895, Croydon, Surrey)\nEmily Ann Williams (7 June 1816 \u2013 16 Dec 1857, Wimbledon, Surrey) - the mother of the landscape painter Charles Leslie\nSidney Richard Percy Williams (1821, London - 13 April 1886, Sutton, Surrey)\nAlfred Walter Williams (18 July 1824, London - 16 December 1905, Croydon, Surrey)\nCharles Williams (18 July 1824 - died shortly after birth)\n\nArt\n\nStyle and influence\nEdward Williams probably began his art career making picture frames, but he was surrounded by relatives who were well-known painters and engravers, and over the years he reinvented himself as a painter. He started by painting miniatures, and copying Baroque landscapes from the 1600s in the style of the Dutch painters Ruisdael (1628-1682) and Hobbema (1638-1709) - the former known for woodland scenes with detailed renderings of trees, particularly the leaves, and water scenes with small boats moored beneath windmills; the latter known for his densely foliated trees with stippled leaves.\n\nAs Edward Williams developed his own style, he moved on to contemporary landscapes of the English countryside that, not surprisingly, hint of some of the work of his uncle George Morland. However, he became best known for moonlit scenes of boats and windmills along the Thames River, which earned him the epithet with the public of \"Moonlight Williams\", or simply the \"moonlight painter\". He rarely signed his work, perhaps but one painting in a hundred, and when he did he signed simply as E.Wms. As a consequence, the work of Old Williams can be difficult at times to distinguish from that of his son Edward Charles Williams, who painted in a similar style and signed his paintings E. Williams.\n\nThe Athenaeum on 14 July 1855 ran an obituary for Edward Williams in which they wrote, \"The name of Mr. E. Williams, the Elder, must be added to the year's obituary. This agreeable landscape painter died, we perceive, in the seventy-fourth year of his age . . . [He] trained what must almost be called a school of landscape painters in his sons . . . whose works . . . do credit to him who trained them. His best landscapes (and none from his had were bad) may now rise in value among the collectors.\" Edward Williams was a master at painting detailed country landscapes in which the figures, if present at all, were generally subordinate to the scenery, but he is perhaps best remembered for passing that style on to six sons, some of whom were among the most popular landscape painters of their time.\n\nPaintings\nSome examples of Edward Williams' work showing the evolution of his painting style.\n\nMuseums\nAnglesey Abbey, Lode near Cambridge, England\nLeeds Art Gallery, Leeds, England\nCastle Museum and Art Gallery, Nottingham, England (2 paintings)\nTate Gallery, London, England (2 paintings)\n Temple Newsam House, Leeds, England\nVictoria and Albert Museum, London, England\nYork Art Gallery, York, England\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Paintings by Edward Williams in British Museums at Art UK\n \"Victorian Landscape Art\"\n\nCategory:1781 births\nCategory:1855 deaths\nCategory:18th-century English painters\nCategory:English male painters\nCategory:19th-century English painters\nCategory:English landscape painters\nCategory:19th-century male artists\n"}, {"id": "BkksMlo4uzkihpfsP-X5", "content": "Edward Charles Williams\n\nEdward Charles Williams (10 July 1807 \u2013 25 July 1881) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian Era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born in London, the eldest son of the painter Edward Williams (1781\u20131855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780\u20131851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward RA and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction. He adopted much of his father's style and technique, and like the other painters of his family, he devoted himself to landscapes, producing rich and tranquil views of Barnes, Cumberland, Kent, Surrey and the Thames. His paintings are now highly sought after.\n\nWilliams married his first wife Mary Ann Challenger on 11 December 1839 in Westminster. Mary Ann died in 1857 in London, and his only child Alice Williams was born shortly afterwards to Sarah Susannah Horley, who had been Mary Ann's nurse \u2013 Edward and Sarah did not marry for another 10 years until 3 October 3, 1868, when they wed at the St. Pancras Old Church in Camden, London.\n\nHe largely stopped painting after the 1859 death of his second wife, adding value to the small number of paintings that he did produce from 1859 on \u2212 Springer in the Bracken, The Lap Dog, The Ploughman's walk home, The Ducks at Tilbury and Primrose at St Mary's (Primrose was the Verger's Cat). Some suggest that he suffered a breakdown after his wife's death, given his choice of subjects in these later years. The location of three of these post-1859 works are unknown, and they are assumed lost during two world wars.\n\nHe signed some of his work as E Williams, which leads to confusion with his father, who painted in a similar style, and at times he signed as C Williams to purposely avoid such confusion. Because many of the paintings of both father and son are unsigned, it can be difficult to correctly attribute their work. Edward Charles also collaborated on several paintings with William Shayer, where Williams would paint the landscape, and Shayer would add in figures and animals; his Near Wantage, Berkshire is a good example. He died 25 July 1881 at Shepherds Bush in London and is buried with Sarah Horley and their daughter Alice in Hammersmith Old Cemetery, close to other family graves.\n\nThe Williams Family\nEdward Charles Williams was born into an artist family that is sometimes referred to as the Barnes School.

He was the third son of the painter Edward Williams (1781-1855) and Ann Hildebrandt (c.1780-1851), and a member of the Williams family of painters, who were related to such famous artists as James Ward, R.A. and George Morland. His father was a well-known landscape artist, who taught him how to paint; otherwise he received no formal instruction.\n\nGeorge Augustus painted riverscapes of the Thames, moonlit landscapes, seascapes and views of Kent, Wales and elsewhere. After having four children, George and Caroline moved to Barnes, London, within a stone's throw of the Thames, where they lived for more than fifty years.\n\nGeorge undoubtedly inherited his artistic talent, as did his siblings, from his father. His work, though, is distinct from that of the others in his family. His paintings were mainly exhibited at Suffolk Street as well as at the Royal Academy from 1841 onwards, the British Institution and elsewhere.\n\nGeorge's wife Caroline died sometime before the 1861 U.K. census was taken, after which his daughter, named Caroline also, became his housekeeper, foregoing marriage to take care of her father. He died forty years later at the age of 87 on 26 May 1901 in Barnes, London.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nGeorge married Caroline Smith (b. 1814), the daughter of Abraham and Charlotte Smith, on 19 February 1835 at St. Pancras Church in Camden, London.

Some sources attribute to him a twin brother named George. However, as his baptismal record proves, George and Walter are the same person. He became a painter like his father, and married another painter Jane Pearcy (1832-1872), with whom he had two children - Florence Ada Williams (1859-1927) and Cyril Stanley Williams (b. 1863) - both of whom became painters as well, but neither of whom achieved any measurable degree of success as artists. Walter remarried two more times, after the deaths of each of his previous wives.\n\nHe is commonly confused with a contemporary, but different, landscape painter named Walter Heath Williams, to whom he is not related. The former generally signed his works Walter Williams or W. Williams, whereas the latter used Walter H. Williams or simply W.H. Williams, the similarity in their signatures adding to the confusion between the two artists. Walter Williams generally painted subjects similar to those by the rest of his family, with bodies of still water next to dense thickets of trees against backdrops of hills and clouds. His paintings tend to be dark in tone with a profusion of green. By contrast, Walter Heath Williams painted landscapes that are much lighter and brighter in tone, characterized by yellows and light browns, his favorite subjects being farm fields with corn stalks and piles of hay.\n\nWilliams lived at 8 Lonsdale Terrace in Surrey for most of his life, and he exhibited a total of 81 paintings at the Royal Academy (10 works), the British Institution (14 works) and the Society of British Artists (47 works). His first wife Jane Williams exhibited some of her works also. He continued to paint after Jane's death, but after the death of his third wife, who is said to have been close to thirty years his junior, he fell into decline and ruin. He finally left his home in poverty in 1902 to enter a work house, and soon lost contact with family and friends. He died at the age of 71 on 14 April 1906 in a poorhouse in Richmond, Surrey and was buried in a pauper's grave. It is said that his sister Caroline Fanny Williams lived just a short distance away, yet was unaware of her brother's passing.\n\nThough incorrectly credited sometimes to Walter Heath Williams, an example of the work of Walter Williams, son of George Augustus Williams is The Pass at Llanberris in the Harris Museum & Art Gallery at Preston Lancashire. Examples probably exist in other British museums as well that are wrongly attributed to his namesake.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPaintings by Walter Williams on  Wikigallery (some are by Walter Heath Williams).\n\nCategory:1834 births\nCategory:1906 deaths\nCategory:19th-century English painters\nCategory:English male painters\nCategory:20th-century English painters\nCategory:English landscape painters\nCategory:Painters from London\n"}, {"id": "BkksMTfxK0fuJQ42O_iB", "content": "Kate Gilbert\n\nKate Gilbert (1843-1916) was an English landscape painter during the Victorian era, and a member of the Williams family of painters.\n\nKate was born Kate Elizabeth Ellen Gilbert-Williams on 17 December 1843 in London, being the only child of the well-known Victorian landscape painter Arthur Gilbert and his first wife Elizabeth Williams.

Her husband died five years into their marriage, after which she lived first with her father, and then after her father's death with her uncle the artist George Augustus Williams. Many of her works date from the late 1880s and the 1890s when she lived with these mentors, no doubt receiving encouragement from them both. She would have also shared the latter household with her cousin Caroline Fanny Williams, the daughter of her uncle, and an accomplished painter as well. When Kate's uncle died, she and Caroline parted company, and she ran a boarding house for a time, before retiring to Sutton, Surrey, where she died on 15 April 1916 at an address on Collingwood Road.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n\nCategory:1843 births\nCategory:1916 deaths\nCategory:19th-century English painters\nCategory:20th-century English painters\nCategory:Landscape artists\nCategory:Painters from London\n"}, {"id": "BkksMzfxK4tBw81te529", "content": "Alfred Gilbert\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert  (12 August 18544 November 1934) was an English sculptor and goldsmith who enthusiastically experimented with metallurgical innovations. He was a central \u2014 if idiosyncratic \u2014 participant in the New Sculpture movement that invigorated sculpture in Britain at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nLife\nAlfred Gilbert's parents, Charlotte Cole and Alfred Gilbert, were musicians who lived at 13 Berners Street, London, where Alfred was born. He spent seven years at Aldenham School in Hertfordshire but received his artistic education mainly in Paris (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, under Jules Cavelier), and studied in Rome and Florence where the significance of the Renaissance made a lasting impression upon him and his art. He also worked in the studio of Sir Joseph Boehm, R.A.\n\nOn 3 January 1876 he married a first cousin, Alice Jane Gilbert (1847\u20131916), with whom he had eloped to Paris. They had five children, one of whom daughter Charlotte became a notable suffragette under the name Caprina Fahey. Bankruptcy made him flee from Britain in 1901 and for the next 25 years he settled in Bruges, Belgium. His wife left him in 1904. They never divorced, but lived separated, Alice being a patient in a mental hospital.\n\nAfter Alice's death in 1916, of which he received news only after the end of World War I, he married on 1 March 1919 his housekeeper St\u00e9phanie Debourgh (1863\u20131937), widow of Alphonse Quaghebeur (1863\u20131903), a typesetter; she, previously a lacemaker, and six of her seven children had lived with Gilbert since 1907 and throughout the War and the German occupation of Belgium. As he was living underground, the presence of a large family was a good cover for the quantity of food needed in the household.\n\nGilbert traveled to Rome in 1923, where his fortunes improved, and three years later was able to return to England to complete the \"Clarence Memorial\", this time under the royal patronage and settled in the study of Lady Helena Gleichen. In that year he was commissioned to produce a final major work, the \"Queen Alexandra Memorial\" which was released in 1932. Gilbert was knighted for this work and was reelected to the RA, so his later years saw their full rehabilitation in the highest echelons of British artistic society, before his death at age 80 in 1934.\n\nWork\n\nHis first work of importance was the charming group of the Mother and Child, then The Kiss of Victory, followed by Perseus Arming (1883), produced directly under the influence of the Florentine masterpieces he had studied. Its success was great, and Lord Leighton forthwith commissioned Icarus, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884, along with a remarkable Study of a Head, and was received with general applause. Then followed The Enchanted Chair, which, along with many other works deemed by the artist incomplete or unworthy of his powers, was ultimately broken by the sculptors own hand.\n\nIn 1888 was produced the statue of Queen Victoria, set up at Winchester, in its main design and in the details of its ornamentation the most remarkable work of its kind produced in Great Britain, and perhaps, it may be added, in any other country in modern times. In 1892\u20131893 Gilbert was occupied with the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, in Piccadilly Circus, London, a work of great originality and beauty representing Anteros. Other statues are those set up to Lord Reay in Bombay, and John Howard at Bedford (1898). Gilbert rose to the full height of his powers in his memorials to the Duke of Clarence and to Lord Arthur Russell and a memorial font to the son of the 4th Marquess of Bath.\n\nGilbert produced the tomb, in St George's Chapel, Windsor, of the Duke of Clarence, described as \"the finest single example of late 19th-century sculpture in the British Isles\". A recumbent effigy of the Prince in a Hussar uniform (almost impossible to see properly in situ) lies above the tomb. Kneeling over him is an angel, holding a heavenly crown. The tomb is surrounded by an elaborate railing, with figures of saints. The perfectionist Gilbert spent too much on the commission, which was the cause of his bankruptcy and leaving the country. Five of the smaller figures were only completed with \"a greater roughness and pittedness of texture\" after his return to Britain in the 1920s.\n\nIn addition to the work already cited he produced busts of Cyril Flower, John R. Clayton (since broken up by the artist, the fate of much of his admirable work), G. F. Watts, Sir Henry Tate, Sir George Birdwood, Sir Richard Owen, Sir George Grove and various others. He designed the statue of David Davies of Llandinam in front of the Barry Docks Offices.\n\nGilbert was chosen associate of the Royal Academy in 1887, full member in 1892 (resigned 1909), and professor of sculpture (afterwards resigned) in 1900. He was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. In 1889 he won the Grand Prix at the Paris International Exhibition. He was created a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1897. While Gilbert was known for his sculpture, he also periodically made oil paintings.\n\nFamous works\n The statue at the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, commonly known as the statue of Eros, in Piccadilly Circus, London\n The tomb of Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence in St. George's Chapel, Windsor\n The Queen Alexandra Memorial, Marlborough Gate, London (a Grade I listed building)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Alfred Gilbert, Sculptor in: British sculpture and sculptors of today. by M.

He first studied at Birmingham Municipal School of Art and then the National Art Training School, now the Royal College of Art. After a short career as an instructor, Gilbert worked at the Bromsgrove Guild, where he was a director, and then at H. H. Martyn. While at the Guild, Gilbert collaborated with Louis Weingartner. When he had moved over to H.H. Martyn, his son, Donald Gilbert, was also employed by the firm, and father and son collaborated on many works. He retired in 1940 and died six years later.\n\nBackground\n\nThe son of Henry Edward Gilbert and Jane Isabella Gilbert, Walter Gilbert was born on 12 August 1871 in Rugby, Warwickshire.  Gilbert and his wife, Ina MacGeoch, had two children.   Margot and Donald were both encouraged to pursue artistic careers and both assisted their father on the Queen Marys interior decoration in the 1920s.  Donald worked with his father on many commissions.\n\nEducation\n\nGilbert had an educational career that spanned western Europe, India and the United States.   First, and under Benjamin Creswick, Gilbert studied at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art and from 1890 to 1893 at the then National Art Training School.  Having completed his studies at these two schools, Gilbert sought out training around the world: in India, the United States, Belgium, France and Germany.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1891 he was drawing master at Rugby School and was then an instructor and headmaster at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire from 1898 to 1900.  In 1898 he co-founded the Bromsgrove Guild with William Whitehouse and the Birmingham architectural firm, Crouch and Butler. From the early 1900s Gilbert often worked in partnership with Swiss modeller Louis Weingartner on commissions for art metal work.\n\nTheir collaborations included, among others:\n\n Liverpool Cathedral reredos for Giles Gilbert Scott\n Masonic Peace Memorial's Grand Temple gates for architects Winston Newman and H. V. Ashley\n Victoria Memorial and Buckingham Palace gates for Sir Aston Webb\n\nGilbert was director of the Guild from 1899 until 1918, then he went to H. H. Martyn where until 1940 he was assistant manager. Weingartner ceased working at the Bromsgrove Guild about the same time as Gilbert. Donald Gilbert became a modeller for H.H. Martyn, collaborating on works with his father. Gilbert retired in 1940.\n\nWalter Gilbert participated in many exhibitions including those at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool in 1884 and Leeds City Art Gallery in 1902 and 1906. During his lifetime Gilbert also involved himself with garden furnishings and the design of glass.\n\nLater years\n\nOn 23 January 1946 at Littlehampton, Sussex, Gilbert died.

He was one of four children and brother to both the well-known artist and critic Walter Bayes, and to the Arts & Crafts designer Jessie Bayes. Bayes' lengthy and illustrious career began as a student under Sir George Frampton and Harry Bates, and so became associated with the British New Sculpture movement and its focus on architectural sculpture.\n\nBayes is perhaps best remembered for his interest in colour, his association with the Royal Doulton Company, and his work in polychrome ceramics and enamelled bronze. His major ceramic frieze at the Doulton Headquarters of 1938 was removed in the 1960s when the building was razed, and re-located to the gallery at the Victoria and Albert Museum which bears his name. He also designed a number of war memorials, with public works throughout the former British Empire, from New South Wales to Bangalore.\n\nBayes served as President of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, PRBS, from 1939 through 1944, and of the Ealing Art Group from 1947-1953.

His primary focus was portrait busts and other sculptures of British royalty and contemporary figures, as well as war memorials. The second-born of eight artists in his family, he and his siblings completed the National War Memorial of Canada after the death of their brother Vernon March in 1930, who had created the winning design. It is the site in Ottawa of annual Remembrance Day ceremonies.\n\nAmong his many commissions, Sydney March also made a memorial to United Empire Loyalists, which was erected in 1929 in Hamilton, Ontario. Several of the siblings never married; they lived and worked together at \"Goddendene\", a 17-room house in Farnborough, Kent, England. They had three large studios and an iron foundry on the grounds.\n\nBackground\n\nSydney March, son of George Henry March and his wife Elizabeth Blenkin, was born in 1876 in Stoneferry, a suburb of Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. He was the second of nine children, eight of whom became artists. At the time of the 1891 census, March was working as a monumental sculptor's apprentice. His father was a seed crusher foreman (oil miller).\n\nBy 1901, the family had moved to Battersea, London, where his father was employed as a builder's clerk. March studied at the Royal Academy Schools. Three of the March children became sculptors: Sydney, Elsie, and Vernon. The other five artists were Edward, Percival, Frederick, Dudley, and Walter. The ninth sibling was a sister, Eva. Their parents died in 1904.\n\nBy 1911, all nine siblings, as yet unmarried, were living together in the 17-room house \"Goddendene\" in Farnborough, Kent, England. Only two of the March siblings married; between them, they had three children. Eva married Charles Francis Newman in 1916. They had a daughter, Heather. Frederick March married Agnes Annie Gow in 1926. They had two children, Elizabeth and Cecil.\n\nCareer\n\nMarch and his siblings established studios at the family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough after 1901. They made three large studios on the seven-acre grounds, and a metal foundry for sculptures. The studio walls could be slid back, such that the artists could work in natural daylight. The ceilings of the studios were so tall that parachutes could be hung to dry here during the war.\n\nIn 1900, the Royal Academy Schools awarded Sydney March first prize, a silver medal, for a model of a statue or group. Between 1906 and 1932, he exhibited thirteen times at te Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts. He exhibited a total of seventeen works at the Royal Academy, primarily portrait busts, statuettes, and equestrian statues.\n\nIn addition to casting works at the family foundry, March also had his work cast by the silversmith and bronze foundry of Elkington & Co. One of March's first commissions was a bust of Edward VII.

Described by Hugh Meller, author of London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide & Gazetteer, as \"arguably the most dramatic sculpture in any of London's cemeteries.\"  The title of the piece is \"The Angel of Death\".\n\nNational War Memorial of Canada\n\nThe March siblings often collaborated on their art pieces. The best known example of this is The Response, the National War Memorial of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario. Sydney's brother Vernon March, after a world-wide competition in 1925, was one of seven finalists of a field of 127 entrants. The seven finalists submitted scale models of their proposed designs. Vernon was awarded the commission in January 1926. Vernon March's  design included bronze figures of Victory and Liberty on top of a granite arch. Below the arch, at the rear, is an unlimbered cannon. The monument includes 22 bronze figures under the arch, representing the branches of the Canadian forces during World War I.\n\nVernon March died of pneumonia in 1930, before the monument had been completed. Together with their sister Elsie March and four brothers, Sydney March completed the bronze figures for the monument by July 1932. However, the site in Canada had not yet been prepared, as construction of the arch in Ottawa was delayed. The bronze figures were mounted on a base and displayed at Hyde Park in London for six months. Later, they were stored at the family studios at Goddendene. In 1937, the bronzes were shipped to Ottawa. After construction of the arch and preparation of the surrounding area, the National War Memorial of Canada was unveiled by King George VI on 21 May 1939. It commemorates the Canadian response in WWI.\n\nBronze figures of the National War Memorial\n\nOther collaborations\n\nOne of the first major pieces on which the March family collaborated was the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial. While Sydney was the primary sculptor, all of the March artists participated in the creation of this monument. It was dedicated to the Inniskilling Fusiliers who died in the Boer War (1899\u20131902). The family erected it in Northern Ireland in 1902. It was initially positioned on High Street in Omagh, County Tyrone, where it was unveiled by the Duchess of Abercorn on 25 November 1904. Considered a traffic hazard as traffic increased greatly, it was relocated in 1964 to Drumragh Avenue in Omagh.\n\nOther art pieces on which the March family collaborated include the Lewes War Memorial, located at School Hill on High Street in Lewes, East Sussex, England. Vernon March was the primary sculptor. The war memorial features a central obelisk of Portland stone, upon which an angel representing Victory is perched, her arms raised, one hand holding a laurel wreath. Other bronze angels sit at the base of the monument; adjacent shields list the names of the deceased soldiers of World War I. The Lewes War Memorial was unveiled in 1922. It was rededicated in 1981 to include the deceased of World War II. It is also on the National Heritage List for England.\n\nThey made a war memorial at Sydenham, London, England, dedicated to the fallen soldiers of World War I and II who were employees of the south suburban gas works. The monument includes a bronze figure of Victory standing on a globe, with serpents at her feet. In addition, bronze plaques listed the names of the deceased soldiers, as well as those from the gas company who served. Sydney March was the primary sculptor for the Livesey Hall War Memorial, also referred to as the Sydenham War Memorial, which was unveiled by Lord Robert Cecil on 4 June 1920. It is on the National Heritage List for England. In October 2011, the three bronze plaques from the front of the memorial were stolen.\n\nDeath\n\nSydney March died at age 92 in the second quarter of 1968 in the county of Kent, England. Most of the members of the March family, including parents George and Elizabeth, are interred at Saint Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough, Kent. Sydney's ashes were buried in the family plot on 22 June 1968. In 1922, Sydney had sculpted the bronze angel that marks the family graves. His last surviving sibling, Elsie March, died in 1974.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe March artists were widely known in their time. A black-and-white, silent movie was filmed in 1924 that explored the March artists at work in their studios at Goddendene. It has been reproduced by British Path\u00e9.\n\nIn April 2011, the Chelsfield Village Voice, the monthly newsletter for the village of Chelsfield in the London Borough of Bromley, reported a recent talk on the March family of artists by local historian and author Paul Rason at the area historical society. He accompanied his lecture with photographs, including one of Sydney's equestrian statue of Lord Kitchener during construction. He had photographs of the March family home of Goddendene, and images of the bronze figures of the National War Memorial of Canada. I\n\nIn 2011, an exhibition was held at the Bromley Museum at The Priory on Church Hill in Orpington. Featuring the work of local artists, the exhibit included scale models made by artists of the March family.\n\nThe National War Memorial of Canada has been the location for Canada's annual National Remembrance Day celebration since 1939. The original model for the National War Memorial is displayed in the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa (pictured).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n National Portrait Gallery \u2013 King Edward VII Photograph of \"King Edward VII\"\n National Portrait Gallery \u2013 Cecil John Rhodes Photograph of \"Cecil John Rhodes\"\n The Armoury of St. James's Photograph of bust of Field Marshal Sir John French\n Sydenham, South Suburban Gas Works WW1 and WW2 War Memorial Photograph of Sydenham War Memorial\n The Victorian Web \u2013 Sculpture \u2013 Sydney March Photograph of Lancaster Monument\n British Path\u00e9 \u2013 Sister and Seven Brothers, 1924 Movie of Sydney March and his seven siblings\n\nCategory:1876 births\nCategory:1968 deaths\nCategory:English sculptors\nCategory:English male sculptors\nCategory:20th-century British sculptors\nCategory:Monumental masons\n"}, {"id": "BkksJgDxK03DGYoMByoL", "content": "Vernon March\n\nVernon March (1891\u20131930) was an English sculptor, renowned for major monuments such as the National War Memorial of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, the Samuel de Champlain Monument in Orillia, Ontario, and the Cape Town Cenotaph, South Africa. Without the benefit of a formal education in the arts, he was the youngest exhibitor at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nBackground\n\nVernon March, son of George Henry March and his wife Elizabeth Blenkin, was born in 1891 in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father was a seed crusher foreman (oil miller) in Yorkshire. By 1901, the March family had moved to Battersea, London, England, where his father worked as a builder's clerk. Vernon was the youngest of nine children, eight of whom had careers as artists. Three of the March siblings became sculptors, Sydney, Elsie, and Vernon. The other five siblings who chose a career in the arts were Edward, Percival, Frederick, Dudley, and Walter. Vernon's ninth sibling was his sister Eva Blenkin March. Their parents George and Elizabeth both died in 1904.\n\nAt the time of the 1911 census, all nine of the March siblings, as yet unmarried, were living together in their 17-roomed home called \"Goddendene\" in Locksbottom, Farnborough, Kent, England. Two of the siblings eventually married, Eva and Frederick, and produced a total of three children between them. Vernon's sister Eva married Charles Francis Newman in 1916.\n They had one child, a daughter, Heather. His brother Frederick married a native of Scotland, Agnes Annie Gow, in 1926. They had two children, Elizabeth and Cecil. Vernon served with the Royal Flying Corps after enlisting on 8 March 1916. He was discharged less than one year later, on 24 January 1917, with a rank of Air Mechanic 2nd Class.\n\nCareer\n\nThe March family established studios at the family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough. In 1911, Vernon exhibited two of his works at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts Annual Exhibition. Between 1907 and 1927, he exhibited seven times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts, with a total of twelve works. Vernon had the distinction of being the youngest exhibitor at the Royal Academy of Arts, as he was just sixteen when his sculpture of Psyche was exhibited and purchased on the third day of the event in 1907.\n\nYears later, the prodigy was awarded the commission for a war memorial in Cape Town, to honour the fallen of World War I. The Cenotaph memorial has a sandstone base and columns, with bronze plaques and figures. It features winged Victory holding a laurel wreath, and standing on top of a globe, a serpent of evil under her feet. The winged figure on the tall central column is flanked by two South African soldiers on shorter columns. The Cenotaph is located on Heerengracht Street. It now commemorates not only the fallen soldiers of World War I, but also World War II and the Korean War. It is the site of the annual Armistice Day wreath-laying ceremony and procession. The Cenotaph was originally unveiled in Adderley Street on 3 August 1924. Street widening in 1959 required that the memorial be moved and reoriented. At that time, additional plaques commemorating the soldiers of World War II and the Korean War were added. The Cenotaph was then unveiled for the second time on 8 November 1959. The Cenotaph was relocated again in 2013, from Adderley Street to Heerengracht Street, to make way for a new MyCiTi bus station.\n\nWhile the Samuel de Champlain Monument in Orillia, Ontario was installed in 1925, a year after the Cape Town memorial, the process began years earlier. Charles Harold Hale was known as \"Mr. Orillia\" due to his myriad accomplishments on behalf of the city. The idea of a monument to Champlain in the city of Orillia was his brainchild. Hale championed the cause and obtained funding for the project. The competition in 1912 for the design garnered twenty-two entries from three countries, Canada, England, and France. The winning entry was submitted by twenty-year-old Vernon March. The initial target date for completion of the monument was August 1915, to honour the 300th anniversary of Champlain's visit to Huronia. However, World War I delayed the project. The Champlain monument was finally unveiled on 1 July 1925 in Couchiching Park in Orillia, Ontario. On a central pedestal stands a twelve foot tall bronze Champlain in full court attire. Below him on one side there is a robed priest holding a cross above Canadian natives. This side symbolises Christianity. On the side symbolising Commerce, there is a fur trader examining a pelt with two additional natives.\n\nA war memorial dedicated to the citizens of Derry, Northern Ireland who lost their lives in World War I was first considered by public leaders in 1919. After several years of efforts at obtaining the necessary funding, the design and location of the monument were approved by the local war memorial committee in April 1925. Vernon March won the commission to build the memorial that he and his brother Sydney March had designed. The Diamond War Memorial is of bronze and Portland stone. In the center, a winged Victory holds aloft a laurel wreath. The tall column on which she stands has the names of the fallen on four sides. At the base of the monument there are two bronze figures on shorter columns, a soldier on one side who represents the Army and a sailor on the other who represents the Navy. The cenotaph is located on The Diamond in the center of the walled city of Derry. It was unveiled on 23 June 1927.\n\nNational War Memorial of Canada\n\nIn 1925, Vernon participated in an open, world-wide competition to design and build the National War Memorial of Canada. He was one of seven finalists out of a total of 127 entrants. The seven finalists then submitted scale models of their designs. Vernon was awarded the commission in January 1926 with his entry of \"The Great Response of Canada.\" His design included Liberty holding a torch and winged Victory a laurel wreath, both bronze figures at the top of a granite arch. Below, a cannon is present at the rear of the monument. In front of the cannon, there are twenty-two bronze soldiers under the arch, representing the branches of the Canadian military forces that existed during the First World War.\n \nWork on the monument had not yet been completed when Vernon died of pneumonia in 1930. Six of his siblings completed the bronze statues for the monument. They moulded the figures in clay and cast them in plaster. Then, the bronzes were finished in their foundry at Goddendene. The family completed the work by July 1932. However, construction of the arch in Canada could not commence because the site in Ottawa had not yet been prepared. The bronze memorial groups were mounted on a base instead, and shown at Hyde Park in London. After six months, they were then transferred to the studio in Farnborough where they remained until they were shipped to Canada in 1937.\n\nAfter a contract was won by Montreal contractors E.G.M. Cape and Company in December 1937, the arch and base for the monument were constructed in Ottawa. Sydney March directed the construction with the assistance of his brothers. The monument, including installation of the bronzes, was finished on 19 October 1938, and landscaping of the area surrounding the memorial commenced. Everything was completed in time for the Royal visit the following spring. The National War Memorial of Canada commemorates the Canadian response during World War I. King George VI performed the unveiling of the monument on 21 May 1939 during a ceremony with an audience of an estimated 100,000.\n\nOther collaborative works\n\nOne of the first monuments on which the March siblings collaborated was the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial; however, Vernon was still a child when it was built and erected. Another project on which the family collaborated was the Lewes War Memorial at School Hill on High Street in Lewes, East Sussex, England. Vernon was the main sculptor for the monument. There is a central obelisk of Portland stone topped by a globe. A bronze winged Victory stands on top of the globe with her arms raised, a laurel wreath in one hand. Two other bronze angels sit near the base of the monument, one on each side. There are adjacent shields, also of bronze, which list the names of the fallen soldiers of World War I. The Lewes War Memorial was unveiled and dedicated on 6 September 1922. It was rededicated on 1 March 1981, to include the deceased soldiers of World War II. On 29 October 1985, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England. A Grade II structure is deemed to be nationally important and of special interest.\n\nThe March family also worked together on the war memorial at Sydenham, London, England. Sydney March was the main sculptor for the monument which is now a tribute to the deceased soldiers of both World War I and II who were employees of the Sydenham South Suburban Gas Works. The memorial in front of Livesey Memorial Hall in the London Borough of Lewisham features a bronze figure of Victory standing atop a globe on a wreathed base, with serpents at her feet. Bronze plaques listed the names of fallen soldiers. The plaques also gave the names of those from the company who served in the wars. The Sydenham War Memorial was unveiled by Lord Robert Cecil on 4 June 1920. Also referred to as the Livesey Hall War Memorial, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England on 30 August 1996. In October 2011, three of the plaques from the front of the monument were stolen.\n\nDeath\n\nVernon March died of pneumonia at age 38 on 11 June 1930 in Farnborough, Kent, England. Most of the members of his family, including his parents George and Elizabeth, were interred at Saint Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough. In 1922, his brother Sydney March had sculpted the bronze angel monument that marked the family grave. Vernon was buried in the family plot on 14 June 1930. His last surviving sibling Elsie March died in 1974.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe April 2011 edition of the Chelsfield Village Voice, the monthly newsletter for Chelsfield, Bromley, described a talk that local historian and author Paul Rason had given the previous month to the area historical society. The subject of the lecture was the March family of artists. The talk was accompanied by photographs of the March family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough. The presentation also included images of the bronze statues of the National War Memorial of Canada. In 2011, an exhibition was held at the Bromley Museum at The Priory in Orpington, Bromley. The exhibition featured the work of local artists, and included scale models by members of the March family. A black and white, silent movie filmed in 1924 followed the March artists as they worked in their studios at Goddendene, and has been reproduced by British Path\u00e9.\n\nThe original model for the National War Memorial is displayed in the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The National War Memorial of Canada has been the site of Canada's annual National Remembrance Day celebration since 1939, the only exception being those times when construction near the site precluded it. Annual Armistice Day celebrations also take place at Vernon March's Cenotaph war memorial in Cape Town, South Africa and include wreath-laying ceremonies and processions.\n\nThe autumn 2010 edition of The Pot, the annual newsletter of the Huronia Chapter of the Ontario Archaeological Society, revealed that the Champlain Monument at Couchiching Park in Orillia had been the site of a ceremony which took place on 16 October 2010. In celebration of the 400th anniversary of the first European visitor to the area, a chapter member played \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9. Events included a flag ceremony, an interview skit, and musical performances. The day's events were a precursor to more elaborate festivities scheduled for 2015, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Champlain's first visit to Orillia.\n\nVernon March's Diamond War Memorial in Derry, Northern Ireland has been the inspiration for the Diamond War Memorial Project. The project began in 2007, one of the primary goals being to research the lives of those inscribed on the memorial and disseminate the information. In the process, hundreds of additional names, never inscribed on the memorial, have been uncovered. Miniatures of the Diamond War Memorial are displayed at Saint Columb's Cathedral.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n erika takacs sculpture \u2013 Samuel de Champlain Monument in Orillia Photographs of Champlain Monument\n Sydenham, South Suburban Gas Works WW1 and WW2 War Memorial Photograph of Livesey Hall War Memorial\n Find A Grave \u2013 Vernon March Photographs of Vernon March, March family grave monument, and National War Memorial\n SilverTiger \u2013 Lewes War Memorial Photograph of angel representing Liberty\n British Path\u00e9 \u2013 Sister and Seven Brothers, 1924 Movie of the March siblings\n\nCategory:1891 births\nCategory:1930 deaths\nCategory:English sculptors\nCategory:English male sculptors\nCategory:20th-century British sculptors\nCategory:Monumental masons\nCategory:Artists from Kingston upon Hull\n"}, {"id": "BkksL__xK6wAnI9u_WN9", "content": "National War Memorial (Canada)\n\nThe National War Memorial  (French: Monument comm\u00e9moratif de guerre), titled The Response (French: La R\u00e9ponse) is a tall, granite memorial arch with accreted bronze sculptures in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, designed by Vernon March and first dedicated by King George VI in 1939. Originally built to commemorate the Canadians who died in the First World War, it was in 1982 rededicated to also include those killed in the Second World War and Korean War and again in 2014 to add the dead from the Second Boer War and War in Afghanistan, as well as all Canadians killed in all conflicts past and future. It now serves as the pre-eminent war memorial of 76 cenotaphs in Canada. In 2000, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was added in front of the memorial and symbolizes the sacrifices made by all Canadians who have died or may yet die for their country.\n\nMonument and context\nThe National War Memorial is the focal point of Confederation Square in Canada's capital city, Ottawa, Ontario. This locates it between Parliament Hill to the west and the Ch\u00e2teau Laurier hotel to the east. There are several other commemorative buildings and monuments nearby, including the Peace Tower (and the Memorial Chamber) at the parliament buildings, the National Aboriginal Veterans Monument, the Animals in War Memorial, a Boer War memorial, the Peacekeeping Monument, the Valiants Memorial, and the War of 1812 Monument.\n\nThe memorial, from grade to the tip of the surmounting statues' wings, is approximately 21.34\u00a0m (70\u00a0ft), with the arch itself 3.05\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) wide, 2.44\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) deep, and 8.03\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 4 in) high. The lowest step of the pedestal is 15.9\u00a0m (52\u00a0ft 2 in) by 8.08\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 6 in). 503\u00a0tonnes of rose-grey Canadian granite from the Dumas Quarry at Rivi\u00e8re-\u00e0-Pierre, Quebec, and 32\u00a0tonnes of bronze were used, all of which rests on a block of reinforced concrete based on steel columns set into bedrock.\n\nTwo  allegories of peace and freedom stand at the apex of the arch, their proximity to each other representing the inseparability of the two concepts, though, the figure bearing a torch alludes in Roman mythology to Demeter and the winged figure with a laurel depicts Nike, the Greek goddesses of agriculture and victory, respectively. Below are the depictions of 22 Canadian servicemen from all branches of the forces and other groups engaged in the First World War. At front, to the left, a Lewis gunner, to the right, a kilted infantryman with a Vickers machine gun. Following these are a pilot in full gear and an air mechanic of the Royal Canadian Air Force, as well as a sailor in the Royal Canadian Navy from HMCS Stadacona. Two mounted figures\u2014a member of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade and a dispatch rider\u2014are emerging from the arch, side by side, followed by two infantry riflemen pressing through the arch and behind them are the men and women of the support services, including two nurses from the Militia Army Medical Corps, a stretcher bearer, and one member each of the Royal Canadian Engineers and the Canadian Forestry Corps. Further, there is one member each of the Canadian Army Service Corps, the Canadian Signals Corps, the Corps of Canadian Railway troops, the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, and the Motor Machine Gun Corps. There are three additional infantrymen; all six carry among them respirators and other items of the \"basic load\" carried by every member of the infantry.\n\nThe figures are moving towards the call of duty atop a pedestal. To avoid foreshortening from a pedestrian viewpoint, the group of figures is placed at a specific height above street level; each body is approximately  high, or one third larger than life size. The postures are animated and strained, not in parade form, and the expressions \"convey pride, longing, defiance, a strong sense of purpose, vacancy, camaraderie and perhaps a touch of dejection, but mostly firm resolve.\" All are in historically correct and distinctly Canadian uniforms, and they were deliberately rendered by the sculpture's artist, Vernon March, so as to not associate any with a particular region of the country nor any ethnicity or language, thus highlighting unity.\n\nOf the memorial, March wrote \"[I intend] to perpetuate in this bronze group the people of Canada who went Overseas to the Great War, and to represent them, as we of today saw them, as a record for future generations...\" The allegorical representations of peace and freedom were meant to be seen \"alighting on the world with the blessings of Victory, Peace and Liberty in the footsteps of the people's heroism and self-sacrifice who are passing through the archway below.\" The persons emerging through the arch have also been interpreted as representing Canada's \"rite of passage\" or \"coming of age\", its birth as a proper nation during the First World War, reflected in its attainment of a place in the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles at the conflict's end. Similarly, the figures of Peace and Freedom \"speak both to Canada's participation in the struggle to achieve lasting stability and democratic values that resulted in the creation of the League of Nations, and to the hope that in Canada itself peace and freedom may continue to triumph over the forces of instability and the tyrannies of ethnicity.\" Laura Brandon, Historian, Art & War at the National War Museum in Ottawa, opined that the agricultural connotations of the torch-bearing figure may have been intended by March to relate to the dominance of agriculture in Canada at the time of the monument's design. It may also refer to the line in the war poem In Flanders Fields, penned by John McCrae while in the battlefields of the First World War: \"The torch; be yours to hold it high/If ye break faith with us who die.\"\n\nOn the north and south faces of the statuary base are the dates 1914\u20131918 (the First World War) above the words Service to Canada/Au service du Canada, which are intended to include all Canadians who served in all armed conflicts, past, present, and future. The dates 1939\u20131945 (the Second World War) and 1950\u20131953 (the Korean War) are on the east and west flanks of the base, while the years 1899\u20131902 (the Second Boer War) and 2001\u20132014 (the War in Afghanistan) are on the east and west arch pier footings, respectively. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier rests in the podium surface immediately in front of and on axis with the war memorial.\n\nModern usage\n\nSince 1940, the National War Memorial is the site of the national Remembrance Day ceremony, organised every year by the Royal Canadian Legion for 11 November. Along with Canadian war veterans, the ceremony is attended by the governor general, sometimes members of the Canadian Royal Family, the prime minister, the Silver Cross Mother, representatives of the Canadian Armed Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, members of the diplomatic corps, and youth representatives. Some of these groups place wreaths at the foot of the war memorial. The event is attended by between 25,000 and 45,000 people and is nationally televised.\n\nBefore each Remembrance Day ceremony, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) repairs and levels stones in the area of the war memorial, fills joints, waxes the bronzes, and applies a protective coating to the lettering on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Plywood is placed over surrounding flower beds and approximately 6,000 metres of cable is run to connect sound systems and 12 television cameras. Any mementos or pictures attendees leave at the memorial following the ceremony are given to the Canadian War Museum for review and possible storage, while any money left is donated to The Perley & Rideau Veterans' Health Centre.\n\nWhenever the monarch or another member of the Royal Family is in Ottawa, they will, regardless of the date, lay a wreath at the monument. Visiting foreign dignitaries will also sometimes lay a wreath at the monument; prominent figures who have done so include US President John F. Kennedy in 1961, Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, US Secretary of State John Kerry, and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2014.\n\nThe Department of Canadian Heritage and the Department of Veterans Affairs also fund summer students at the site, hired to provide site and historical information.\n\n2014 Terror attack \nFull Article: 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa#National War Memorial\n\nThe 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill were a series of shootings that occurred on October 22, 2014, at Parliament Hill in Ottawa. At the Canadian National War Memorial, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty was fatally shot by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.\n\nShortly before 10:00 a.m. EDT, on October 22, 2014, witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau arrive at the National War Memorial carrying a rifle, which was later identified as a .30\u201330 Winchester Model 94 lever-action hunting rifle. He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, with a keffiyeh scarf over the lower part of his face. He approached Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), who was one of three sentries from the Ceremonial Guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At close range, Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo twice in the back, fatally wounding him. Cirillo, like all others who have stood sentry at the memorial, carried an unloaded firearm. It was only minutes before the end of the sentries' shift, which ended at 10:00 a.m. Cpl. Kyle Button and Cpl. Branden Stevenson, two other soldiers on sentry duty, attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but they were shot at by him and forced to flee to the other side of the Memorial. Zehaf-Bibeau then pulled down his scarf, held his rifle one-handedly over his head and yelled, \"For Iraq.\" Cpl. Anthony Wiseman, who was nearby, then attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but Zehaf-Bibeau attempted to run him over. The three soldiers then attended to Cirillo. Along with bystanders, they applied first aid to Cirillo, attempting to resuscitate him, before Paramedic Chief Anthony DiMonte was first on scene assumed patient care until and additional Paramedics arrived to provided medical care before Cirillo was taken to hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, Zehaf-Bibeau returned to his vehicle, a small grey Toyota car, which was parked on the south side of Wellington Street behind the memorial, and drove west along Wellington a short distance to Parliament Hill, where he abandoned his vehicle. Past scattering bystanders, he ran through a gate in the fence surrounding the Parliament Hill precinct and carjacked a parliamentary vehicle assigned to ministers of the Crown, which he drove to the Centre Block parliament building. RCMP officers on patrol in the precinct witnessed the carjacking and pursued the vehicle to the base of the Peace Tower.\n\nA photograph of Zehaf-Bibeau was taken by a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings. It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of his face, with part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own photograph of the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received a copy of the photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his computer monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image. The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.\n\nHistory\n\nConception and debate\nThe subject of a memorial to commemorate those killed in the First World War was raised even before the conflict had ended; Prime Minister Robert Borden said in 1915 \"[i]t is my desire and intention that some splendid monument shall be erected in this country, perhaps in the capital of the Dominion, which will commemorate the men who responded so splendidly to the call of duty.\" There was opposition to the idea, mostly to its cost, especially as the argument continued through the Great Depression. The Lord Beaverbrook initiated, in partnership with the government, the Canadian War Memorial Fund (CWMF) in April 1918 with the purpose of \"perpetuating the memory of what Canada has accomplished in this war\" through paintings, photographs, and the erection of memorials. An early proposal in 1919 was a memorial hall in Ottawa, to act as a social centre for between 2,000 and 4,000 people as well as a monument to the Canadians who served in the Great War. It did not grow past the concept stage, but, an idea from the CWMF for a memorial building did progress to the detail design phase. It would have resembled the Pantheon in Rome and housed the art in the CWMF's collection, while acting \"as a great war memorial in itself.\" Immediately after the war's end, however, focus shifted to the burial of the dead: the design of markers and headstones.\n\nTo meet a growing call across Canada for a memorial to commemorate those who died in the First World War, the Cabinet of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King suggested in 1921 that a national memorial be built in Canada. The Ottawa Citizen on 19 December 1922 reported that the government was going to announce a plan to erect just such a monument and, in parliament on the last day of the session, the Cabinet requested appropriation for a war memorial to be built in Ottawa. A site in the Gatineau Hills was originally considered but it was determined the best option was the redevelopment and expansion of downtown Ottawa's Connaught Place into a plaza for the memorial, giving it the parliament buildings\u2014the seat of Canadian democracy\u2014as a backdrop. This, Mackenzie King later said, put it in the most visible spot in the city, akin to The Cenotaph and Nelson's Column in London, England.\n\nIn May 1923, the Minister of Public Works James Horace King asked the legislature to approve $10,000 for the memorial. However, with the minister unable to satisfactorily answer members' questions on what the money would be used for and the Prime Minister absent, it was determined to leave the matter for another time. Subsequently, the issue was again raised on 11 May 1923, when King stated \"[i]n every country in the world the spirit of the nation has found some expression in regard to great events in the form of permanent monuments if the occasions have been sufficiently worthy of such recognition from the national point of view. The government felt that a monument should be erected in the capital of Canada expressive of the feelings of the Canadian people as a whole to the memory of those who had participated in the Great War and had lost their lives in the service of humanity.\" In response to a statement by Murray MacLaren that the central column of Confederation Hall (the main entrance) of the new Centre Block already had an inscription noting the service of Canadians who had fought overseas, Mackenzie King said the inscription made reference to many other events in Canadian history and, as such, was never meant to act as a national war memorial; he elaborated: \"there is, as of yet, no monument of a national character in the capital of the Dominion\" and what the Cabinet proposed was \"intended to be a national monument in the national capital.\"\n\nIn further debate, it was said the project should strive for \"something loftier than a monument in stone\" and not reflexively \"follow precedent, to follow ancient countries.\" Generally, the opposition was in favour of the idea, but criticised the projected costs. Mackenzie King responded: \"When a nation loses what is signified by its art it loses its own spirit, and when it loses the remembrance of the sacrifices and heroism by which it has gained the liberty it enjoys, it loses all the vision that makes a people great.\" Indeed, the Prime Minister managed to force Members of Parliament who critiqued the idea of spending money on a memorial to defend their patriotism and gratitude for those who had died or been wounded in the war. Parliament approved $10,000 to begin the project.\n\nDesign and construction\nOver two years, the parameters for a competition were created by a team consisting of, among others, the Deputy Minister of Public Works, J. B. Hunter, who had experience with the process of creating numerous memorials in Canada; Eric Brown, former Director of the National Gallery of Canada and a member of the Canadian War Artists Advisory Committee; and Colonel H. C. Osborne, who acted as Honorary Secretary of the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission. On 12 February 1925, design proposals were sought, with a budget for the monument set at $100,000. Entrants were limited to residents of the British Empire who were British subjects or who were citizens of allied nations. The competition regulations outlined the monument was intended to not be simply a tribute to those who has contributed to Canada's effort in the First World War, but also an expression of the nation's character. It was to evoke \"the spirit of heroism, the spirit of self-sacrifice, the spirit of all that is noble and great that was exemplified in the lives of those sacrificed in the Great War, and the services rendered by the men and women who went overseas.\" The competition brief explained \"[w]hile the spirit of victory is essential it should be expressed so as to not only immortalize Canada's defenders, but convey a feeling of gratitude that out of this great conflict a new hope has sprung for future prosperity under peaceful conditions.\" Absent from the document was reference to the Empire, focusing only on Canada and its efforts. This illustrated the desire for the war memorial to be a marker of Canada's attainment of nationhood.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-seven entries were submitted\u201466 from Canada, 24 from England, 21 from France, seven from the United States, five from Belgium, two from Italy, one from Scotland, and one from Trinidad.\u2014of which seven were asked to provide scale models for final judging. Tasked with judging the proposals was the Board of Assessors, composed of three people drawn from Canada's architectural and artistic fields: Henry Sproatt was chosen by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada; Herman A. MacNeil by the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts; and, by the Cabinet, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada F.J. Shepherd. From among seven finalists, the winner, announced on 18 January 1926, was Vernon March from Farnborough, United Kingdom. His theme was the response of Canada to war, signified by the uniformed figures, in the then correct order of precedence, passing through the arch, but with a deliberate aim to avoid the glorification of armed conflict. March wrote in his anonymous submission that the figures' expressions would not show any combative attitude. Rather, they would \"express movement and the eagerness and enthusiasm of the people\" to respond to the call.\n\nWork on the memorial began in 1926 under the auspices of the Dominion's Department of Public Works. March was assisted by his six brothers and his sister, all of whom completed the work after March's death in 1930. His design was, over the ensuing years, revised and adjusted: the number of figures and certain dimensions increased and, accordingly, so did the estimated cost, by $85,000. This gave fuel to the parliamentary opposition, who argued the money could be better spent aiding veterans. Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP) J. S. Woodsworth asserted in 1931: \"[i]f there is a contract\u2026we must go through with it... but with poor unemployed soldiers in the country, I do not think we shall need many monuments for a while.\"\n\nEven through the time R. B. Bennett served as prime minister (1930 to 1935), the officials overseeing the war memorial project continued to adhere to the design principles set out by Mackenzie King and the other competition directors, demonstrating a bipartisan support for the memorial. As the accuracy of the uniforms and equipment\u2014at March's request, down to details such as buttons and straps\u2014was directed by Canadian officials, the sculptures were first produced in clay, from which moulds were made and the bronze was then cast in the Marchs' foundry. This work was finished in July 1932 and the bronzes were, with the permission of King George V, put on display  in Hyde Park, London, within a mock-up of the granite arch and plinth. It was then that more than one member of the public pointed out that the archway was too narrow for the artillery carriage to pass through. This led the Marchs to make the arch three feet wider and six feet taller and enlarge the size of the plinth the figures would be mounted on. Those moves, though, created gaps on either side of the crowd of bronze statues, which Sydney March felt negatively impacted the overall appearance of the monument. His proposed solution was to add another three figures to the existing 19. This was approved, the bronze figures were cast, and the entire collection was put in storage at the Marchs' foundry as argument continued in Ottawa over the monument's location.\n\nDisapproval or blatant rejection of the Connaught Place site was expressed by the Federal District Commission (predecessor of the National Capital Commission), Mayor J. E. Stanley Lewis, social commentators, journalists, and members of the public.  Some groups demanded the war memorial be central on Parliament Hill, others said a spot overlooking the Ottawa River, west of parliament was more appropriate. Even the French architect Jacques Gr\u00e9ber, whom Mackenzie King (once again prime minister) had spoken to about the beautification of downtown Ottawa and was thought to be a supporter of the idea to put the war memorial in Connaught Place, penned a report on the redevelopment of Ottawa in which he recommended the monument to the war dead be put in Major's Hill Park. However, after Mackenzie King pointed out that the park would not be as hospitable or accessible during the winter months, Gr\u00e9ber agreed and drew up plans for the Connaught Place site.\n\nThe bronzes were finally relocated to Ottawa in the summer of 1937, accompanied by Sydney, Percival, and Walter March. In December, after years of bickering, the contract for the construction of the pedestal and arch was awarded to E.G.M. Cape and Company of Montreal. The entire cenotaph was completed on 19 October 1938, after which the landscaping surrounding the memorial was laid out and installed by Toronto contractors A.W. Robertson Limited with consultation from Gr\u00e9ber. The cost by that point had risen to over $1,300,000. Conservative MP Alonzo Hyndman quipped: \"if those soldiers were to come back to-day and look at the memorial... and realize that $1,300,000 was being spent on it, while [their] sons and daughters... are walking the streets of Ottawa hungry, barefoot and without jobs... No wonder the sculptor has depicted the soldiers going through the arch with their heads hanging down, as though perplexed at what is going on.\" Still, the figures of peace and freedom were placed atop the granite arch on the same day the Munich Agreement was signed in Germany. Mackenzie King was optimistic: \"Canada will remember throughout her history,  that these two symbolical figures found their place at the top of the National Memorial on September the 30th, the day of the signing of the 4-power agreement which averted another Great War.\"\n\nDedication and onward\n\nThe memorial was officially dedicated on 21 May 1939 by King George VI, the then reigning Canadian monarch, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth, Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir, Mackenzie King, and an estimated 100,000 people, including some 12,000 veterans, attending. The site was decorated with banners depicting the heraldic elements of the Royal Arms of Canada. In his speech, the King focused on Canada having, through defending decency and democracy, reached nationhood among other Western countries. He said: \"On the battlefields of Europe and throughout the Dominion, there are many memorials to Canada's honoured dead. Today, in her own capital, Canada dedicates her national memorial. [It] speaks to the world of Canada's heart... Something deeper than chivalry is portrayed. It is the spontaneous response of the nation's conscience. The very soul of the nation is here revealed.\" After the formal ceremony, the King and his wife made their way to talk to gathered veterans. After doing so, the cheering crowd broke through military and police lines to \"greet them [the King and Queen] personally as fellow citizens\"; reporters noted that a king and queen had never before \"walked unescorted in the midst of such a multitude.\" It is thought that \"O Canada\" became the de facto national anthem after the King remained at attention during its playing at the dedication of the National War Memorial; George, though, was actually following a precedent set by his brother, Edward, the previous king of Canada, when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936.\n\nDespite the joyous environment, Mackenzie King felt the monument's allusions to the sacrifice required for peace and freedom would soon take on greater force: he and the King both were now certain another war was looming. They were proven correct and, after Canada became involved in further military conflict in and after September 1939, the symbolism of the National War Memorial came into question. While the monument in Ottawa was unofficially becoming a symbol of Canada's dead in all of the wars it fought in, the Royal Canadian Legion argued that new memorials should be created to mark the service of Canada's military in the Second World War and Korean War; the problem with The Response, they argued, was \"the heroic figures of our present National War Memorial portray Canada's fighting men of the First World War so faithfully as to render it unsuitable as a memorial to our fallen in World War II and the Korean War.\" In 1947, Jacques Gr\u00e9ber, who continued to work on the development and beautification of Ottawa, designed a traditional monument to the Canadians who died in the Second World War, locating it in the Gatineau Hills, in a manner similar to the Vimy memorial in France and visible from downtown Ottawa. After veterans' groups complained the location would be difficult for tourists to reach, Gr\u00e9ber suggested placing the dates 1939\u20131945 on The Response. Veterans found that unacceptable, as well, insisting that monument was to commemorate the dead of the First World War only. The federal government stated before the close of the Korean War that the East and West Memorial Buildings on Wellington Street would serve as a commemoration of the Canadian men and women who served in the Second World War; a lintel was built between the two structures and on it placed the inscription: ALL THESE WERE HONOURED IN THEIR GENERATIONS AND WERE THE GLORY OF THEIR TIMES. Veterans' groups were again unsatisfied. In a brief given by the Royal Canadian Legion to the Cabinet on 10 November 1955, it was outlined that the organisation wanted a national cenotaph, that would \"honour the fallen of all wars\", placed in front of the Peace Tower.\n\nIn 1963, the matter became more prominent when the federal Cabinet announced a plan to have a national shrine of remembrance built at Nepean Point to house the Books of Remembrance and a cenotaph  to commemorate \"the service and sacrifice of the veterans and war dead of all wars.\" Architects from Toronto and Quebec City were asked by the Cabinet to draw up plans for such a memorial complex and the announcement was made on 19 February 1963 by the Minister of Public Works, Davie Fulton, that the project would be completed for the Canadian Centennial in 1967. However, this plan never came to fruition, as it was denounced by some of the media, various organizations, veterans, a large number of Canadians, and eventually parliamentarians, even in the governing Liberal Party. The meaning of the war memorial in Confederation Square had shifted in the public consciousness; through its location in downtown Ottawa, renovations to Confederation Square to further highlight The Response, and its constant use as a site for national Remembrance Day services (especially through the Second World War, as Canadians were dying overseas), it had come to represent in the Canadian collective consciousness all of Canada's war dead.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Legion requested in 1980 that the Crown rededicate the National War Memorial so as to formally recognise the sacrifices of those who had fought in the Second World and Korean Wars. Wishing to not repeat the confusion and problems around the national shrine of remembrance, the then Minister of Veterans Affairs, Dan MacDonald, almost immediately agreed to the proposal. The monument was re-dedicated on 29 May 1982 by Governor General Edward Schreyer, with the dates 1939\u20131945 and 1950\u20131953 added. the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was added before the monument in 2000 and dedicated by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on 28 May of that year.\n\nDr. Michael Pilon, a retired Canadian Forces major, observed and photographed a group of young men urinating on the war memorial on the evening of Canada Day 2006. Two teenagers later issued apologies and undertook community service. Another 23-year-old man of Montreal was charged with mischief by the Ottawa Police Service, though he later claimed to have no memory of the event.  The incident, along with the common sight of persons skateboarding and riding bicycles on the memorial's podium, prompted the posting of sentries at the site, though they are only present between 9\u00a0am and 5\u00a0pm from 9 April to 10 November.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, a gunman, armed with a rifle, shot at the sentries on duty at the tomb, fatally wounding one, Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), before proceeding across the street and into the Centre Block parliament building. There, the gunman was killed in a firefight inside the building. Cirillo (and Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent) was mentioned by Governor General David Johnston in his speech at the Remembrance Day ceremony of that same year, when the Governor General and Anne, Princess Royal (who brought a message from Queen Elizabeth II), re-dedicated the monument once again. A plaque commemorating Corporal Cirillo's service at the War Memorial was dedicated at the site. The representation of the National War Memorial itself was also expanded to include to those who served in the Second Boer War, the War in Afghanistan, and to \"formally recognize all Canadians who served in the past, who serve today, and who will serve in the future.\" In that respect, the dates \"1899-1902\" (of the Boer War) and \"2001-2014\" (covering Canadian involvement in the Afghan War) were added to the monument.\n\nCommemoration\nOn 15 May 1939, the Post Office Department issued a stamp called National Memorial, designed by Herman Herbert Schwartz based on a picture engraved by Joseph Keller. A model of the war memorial also sits in the Royal Canadian Legion's Hall of Honour at the Canadian War Museum and the legion offers lapel pins depicting the monument.\n\nSee also\n\n Canadian war memorials\n Remembrance Day\n 1939 royal tour of Canada\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe National War Memorial \u2013 Veterans Affairs Canada\nNational Film Board of Canada: The Royal Visit (dedication of the National War Memorial at 32 minute mark)\nGoogle Maps\n\nCategory:1939 establishments in Ontario\nCategory:Sculptures by Vernon March\nCategory:Canadian military memorials and cemeteries\nCategory:Military history of Canada\nCategory:1939 sculptures\nCategory:World War I memorials in Canada\nCategory:World War II memorials in Canada\nCategory:Monuments and memorials in Ottawa\nCategory:Canada in World War I\nCategory:Cenotaphs in Canada\nCategory:Terminating vistas in Canada\nCategory:Bronze sculptures in Canada\nCategory:Statues in Canada\n"}, {"id": "BkksMi04uzli7OLlTvlw", "content": "Boer War Memorial (Montreal)\n\nThe Boer War Memorial is a monument of sculptor George W. Hill located at Dorchester Square in downtown Montreal, in Quebec, Canada.\n\nOverview \n\nThe Boer War Memorial, sculpted by George W. Hill (1862\u20131934), was unveiled in Dominion Square (now known as Dorchester Square) on May 24, 1907. Its inscriptions say: 'In grateful recognition of the patriotism and public spirit shown by Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal in raising and equipping a regiment of horse for service in South Africa as evidence of his sympathy with the cause of imperial unity.'; and on the opposite side, 'To commemorate the heroic devotion of the Canadians who fell in the South African War and the valour of their comrades.'\n\nIt is the only equestrian statue in Montreal, and atypically, is not mounted, but restrained. The Boer War Memorial faces north, towards Mount Royal Cross, which would have been visible from the square until 1929. Around the base of the statue are copper reliefs and the names of each battle. The memorial faces south-east. Montreal's First World War cenotaph is in Place du Canada to the south.\n\nThe Boer War was widely unpopular in Quebec society, viewed as an imperial war. Prime Minister of Canada Wilfrid Laurier opposed the war, but ultimately compromised with the proposal for militia and volunteers en lieu of conscription.\n\nFor two decades after the war, Canadians would gather on February 27 (known in Canada as \"Paardeberg Day\") around memorials to the South African War to say prayers and honour veterans. This continued until the end of the First World War, when Armistice Day (later called Remembrance Day) began to observed on November 11.\n\nThe four principal monuments \u2013 the others being the Robert Burns Memorial, Wilfrid Laurier Memorial, and Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Fountain \u2013 in the square are arranged to form a five equilateral cross with the kiosk towards the Dominion Square Building.\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the official first shovelful of dirt was lifted in the $23-million project to restore Dorchester Square and Place du Canada near the Boer War memorial monument.\n\nSee also \n South African War Memorial (Halifax)\n South African War Memorial (Toronto)\n\nReferences \n\nCategory:1907 in Canada\nCategory:Buildings and structures completed in 1907\nCategory:Canadian military memorials and cemeteries\nCategory:Downtown Montreal\nCategory:Monuments and memorials in Montreal\nCategory:Outdoor sculptures in Montreal\nCategory:Second Boer War memorials\nCategory:Equestrian statues in Canada\n"}, {"id": "BkksLQ_xK0iAstKA6dCS", "content": "Victoria Park, London, Ontario\n\n[[File:Victoria Park WWI statue06.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=Boer War Monument by George William Hill|Boer War Monument, George William Hill\nVictoria Park is an  park located in downtown London, Ontario, in Canada. It is one of the major centres of community events in London.\n\nHistory\nThe park was originally the site of the British garrison, as well as the cricket grounds. The garrison was expanded with new buildings during and after the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837. The British troops withdrew to Europe in 1853 to train for the Crimean War, but their barracks were used to house escaped slaves from the United States, as one of the end stations of the Underground Railway. The troops returned in 1861, fearing that the American Civil War might spread to Canada. In 1874, the park was transferred to the city and renamed Victoria Park, after Queen Victoria.\n\nThe park's original plan was the work of the landscape architect Charles H. Miller, chief gardener of Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and designer of the American Centennial Exposition grounds. It is believed that the decision to hire Miller was strongly influenced by William Saunders' visit to the exposition grounds in 1876.\n\nAlthough designated for recreational activities, the park was still used as a military garrison when necessary. As London was the centre of the Western Ontario military district (District No. 1), troops were stationed in the park during the Second Boer War, World War I, and World War II; there was some minor rioting in the park during the Conscription Crisis of 1944, when conscripts demanded to be sent to Europe.\n\nIn 1907, three cannons from the Crimean War were placed in the park, originally from Sevastopol. In 1912 a statue was built as a memorial to the Boer War, and an exact replica of the cenotaph in Whitehall, London, England was built in 1934. A Sherman tank (known as the \"Holy Roller\") used in World War II was placed there in 1950. While the park once housed elaborate fountains and a lilypond, there are no water features remaining today.\n\nActivities\nMany annual events are held in Victoria Park. These include Sunfest, the Home County Folk Festival, The London Rib-Fest, The International Food Festival, LOLA and Fiesta del Sol. Since 2008 all events in Victoria Park are part of the Greening of the Festivals and required to have a waste management plan to eliminate unnecessary waste to landfill. This includes a suitable number of Eco-Stations (the place where attendees dispose of waste) and all food and beverage containers are required to be either recyclable or compostable. In the first year, these efforts led to an improvement from 5% waste diversion to a 50% waste diversion from landfill. The festivals were recognized Nationally with a Home Town Heroes Award, Provincially with a Gold Award from the Recycling Council of Ontario for Minimization of Waste and Municipally with the Pillar non profit Community Impact Award. Home County Folk Festival had the added initiative of offering reusable metal dishes, available on deposit which is repaid at the Eco-Stations, to eliminate one time use disposables altogether. With the EcoStations readily available for waste disposal, Victoria Park has been a cleaner park throughout the festival season. In addition, the festivals have educated hundreds of thousands of festival attendees on wasteful practices and inspired them to take these practices to their community events, birthday parties and church suppers.\n\nEvery winter, there is an annual vigil for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique Massacre, the trees in the park are decorated with Christmas lights, the \"Lighting of the Lights\" and Snowfest is held in February. The number and frequency of events has been a concern for the park with the resulting damage to the foliage, prompting some partial rescheduling to minimize the wear.\n\nThe park also has an ice skating rink in the winter, which has been built every winter since 1913. The bandshell was built in 1950 (rebuilt in 1990). The area in front of the bandshell now serves as a free, public skatepark, consisting of many metal benches and a stage drop. Near the bandshell is the Women's Memorial for the victims of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre in Montreal, built in 1994.\n\nThe park is notable for the presence of a large number of melanistic (black) Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), and because of this, the recreational sport of squirrel fishing has developed in the area. However the squirrel population is not indigenous; they were first introduced to the park in 1914, when four pairs of squirrels were purchased. In February 1961 a group of squirrels were taken to Kent State University, in Ohio, United States, where they have become firmly established.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nBehr, Sylvia I., et al. (1995).

Established in 1793 as the burial place for those affiliated with the nearby Toronto Garrison (Fort York). It was the first cemetery to be used by European settlers in what would become the city of Toronto. Originally known as St. John's Square, the park today is part of Fort York National Historic Site, and the site of a monument to the War of 1812 sculpted by Walter Seymour Allward and completed in 1902.\n\nHistory\n\nThe cemetery was established by Governor John Graves Simcoe and the first burial in the cemetery was his infant daughter Katherine (January 16, 1793 - April 19, 1794). It served as the military cemetery for Toronto until 1863 and saw some 400 burials, including a number of victims of the War of 1812.\n\nWhen the Town of York was incorporated as the City of Toronto in 1834, its 'New Town' grid was extended from Peter Street to as far west as Garrison Creek creating the 'New Town Extension' with its curved Niagara Street, later extended a block closer to the Garrison Creek with Walnut Street. Victoria Square was one of four squares in the 'New Town Extension'; Clarence Square, McDonell Square and West Market Square were the others. McDonell Square became the site of St. Mary's Church and was renamed Portugal Square in 1960. In the West Market Square, St. Andrew's Market was established to rival St. Lawrence Market in the 'Old Town' to the east.\n\nThe cemetery reached capacity in 1863 and was closed and largely abandoned. Over the decades, neglect and vandalism resulted in there today being only 17 surviving grave stones. In the late 19th century it was turned into a public park and has served as such since. It was restored between 2009-2011. Led by the Wellington Place Neighbourhood Association and Toronto Councillor Adam Vaughan, restoration included regrading, and elements such as lighting, pathways, street furniture, trees and other plantings, and a playground.\n\nSee also\nCanadian war memorials\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCity of Toronto - Virtual Exhibit\n\nCategory:Cemeteries in Toronto\nCategory:Parks in Toronto\nCategory:Public squares in Toronto\nCategory:Canadian military memorials and cemeteries\nCategory:1793 establishments in Canada\nCategory:Monuments and memorials in Toronto\n"}, {"id": "BkksMJHxK7EjfEDCbwJ_", "content": "Victoria Square, Ontario\n\nVictoria Square is an unincorporated community in Markham, Ontario, Canada.

The area was initially called Heise Hill for the Heise family whom were part of the first wave of settlers.\n\nThe first church (Primitive Methodist) was built in 1830s on the east side of 4th Line, where the cemetery is still located. The Wesleyan Methodists built a wood-frame church south of the Victoria Square corner in 1845. This was replaced by a red brick edifice in 1880 at what was once William Frisby's old blacksmith shop.\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodists and Primitive Methodist merged locations in 1884 at what is now Victoria Square United Church.\n\nA number of business emerged in the 1830 at the intersection of 4th Line and 18th Line:\n\n William Frisby blacksmith and farm implement shops southeast corner \n William Cantly's inn emerged in the 1830s on the northeast corner and later became a tavern when William Durose was granted a licence in 1849 \n Post office was opened in the northwest corner in 1854\n \nBy 1860 and 1870s a few more businesses appeared: \n\n carriage maker - Joseph Hall\n John Rowbotham, former wheelwright with Frisby opened a shop manufacturing wagons and bobsled maker and repair to implements for Frisby\n\nThe 1877 SS No. 69 was opened further south and was used until 1966. The building was altered and became a business then as residence until it was restored back for use as a Montessori school in 2010.\n\nThe farmer implement related business would eventually disappear with competition of larger rivals in Toronto.  The tavern destroyed by fire in the early 1900s was not replaced and the post office closed in 1914.\nThe four corners were replaced by residences wiping out all traces of commercial activity in the area.\n\nModern Community\n\nToday's residential development of the area began in the 2006 with the development of Cathedraltown, Ontario to the south and west of Victoria Square and accelerated with the building of Woodbine Bypass in 2010.\n\nToday, farmlands are slowly but progressively disappearing in the area and replaced with newer executive homes in the Unionville Hamlet. Most homes in the area are single-family dwellings. Farms now only exists in to the east of Victoria Square Boulevard and north of Major Mackenzie Drive. \n\nA number of business that operate off the land exists in Victoria Square:\n\n 19th Avenue Farmers' Market is a new generation of farming family whom operate a market and pick your own fields at 19th Avenue and Woodbine Avenue.\n\n Baker Saddlery - business selling equestrian equipment\n\nNew business to the area include Honda Canada Inc. Canadian corporate office and Mobis Parts Canada (a subsidiary of Hyundai).\n\nThe modern community of Victoria Square is bounded by 19th Avenue, Warden Avenue, Woodbine Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive.\n\nThere are a few reminders in the new area of the originally settlers whom farmed the area:\n\n Frisby Park - named for Frisby family\n Boynton Circle - named for Boynton family\n\nParks and recreation\n Victoria Square Park\n Victoria Square Community Centre\n Cathedral (King David) Park\n Frisby Park\n Vine Cliff Park\n Hazelton Park\n Fletcher's Field\n Mossy Stone Park\n Charity Crescent Park\n\nEducation\n\nThere are three public elementary schools:\n\n Sir Wilfrid Laurier Public School (French Immersion, Grades 3-8)\n Sir John A Macdonald Public School\n Victoria Square Public School (Opened September 2018) (Dual Track French Immersion (Grades 1&2 FI, JK-8 English)\n\nTransportation\nDue to its northerly location, most commuters in the area use the regional roads and Ontario Highway 404. The area is serviced by York Region Transit. The former Woodbine Avenue Bypass or Victoria Square Boulevard, Elgin Mills Road,  Major Mackenzie Drive and Warden Avenue are the main arterial roads serving the area.\n\nNearby communities\n\nOther than Gormley, Victoria Square is surrounded by planned residential communities created from former farmlands.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Neighbourhoods in Markham, Ontario\n"}, {"id": "BkksL-XxK4tBytiFLRS9", "content": "Markham Village, Ontario\n\nMarkham Village (2006 population 6,090)  (Census Tract No. 5350400.03 and 5350400.12) is the historic city centre of Markham, Ontario, Canada. Originally settled in 1825, the village -- originally named \"Reesorville\" (reference to the Reesors settlers) sometime after 1804 and also known as \"Mannheim\" (likely after Mannheim) -- was a founded by Mennonites from Upstate New York and Pennsylvania. Eventually, as Upper Canada started to experience immigration from the British Isles, Markham would also experience such growth from Britain. By 1825, the name \"Markham\" was established as the permanent name. In 1850, the police village is created, but it does not include the villages of Unionville and Thornhill (which would later join in 1971 when the Town of Markham is created). The village becomes a police village in 1931. Markham Village was located within York County, Ontario (Upper Canada until 1840 and Canada West until 1867).\n\nPopulation\nAs of 2011, Census tract profile for 0400.07 (CT) currently has a population of 3397 compared to 3418 in 2006 (Census/NHS 2011, Census 2006). This decrease in population may have been due to issues affecting this area including the high costs of property or simply birth and death rates within the area. In addition, Markham's current economic expansions in both the public services (housing, construction, public services, etc.) and finances, it is forecast that Markham will see a population drop from those deciding to move away as a result of high priced real estate.  It is currently estimated that a single family, detached home costs approximately one million Canadian dollars in Markham.\n\nMarkham Village Community Centre\n\nMarkham Village Community Centre is located on the southeast corner of Main Street Markham and Highway 7 (Side Road Allowance). It was the former site of the Markham Fair and (William Armstrong's and later Robert Goodfellow Armstrong's) Wellington Hotel. The community centre features a library (c. 1981 and renovated 2009), community rooms (above rink) and indoor ice rink (c. 1963 with rink seating for 450 originally for hockey and now home to skating club). and drop off recycling centre. The community centre is configured on a north-south axis, where as the old Agricultural Hall was east-west with much of it now occupied by the current day parking lot.\n\nVeterans Square and Cenotaph\nIn the southwest corner of Markham Road and Highway 7 is the Markham Cenotaph. The area is used for annual Remembrance Day ceremonies.\n\nBuilt in 1981 by Phillip Carter, the current memorial was re-vamped (2017-2018) with a new Veterans Square and Cenotaph which features an obelisk-like cenotaph and dedicated to the men and women who fought for Canada's freedom.  An earlier memorial by Rebecca Sisler (c. 1967) was moved indoors into the community centre in 1996.\n\nMain Street Markham Farmers\u2019 Market\n\nFrom early May to early October a farmers market is set up along Robinson Street just west of Main Street. The market features local products and live entertainment and runs every Saturday from 8am to 1pm from May to October.\n\nEducation\n\nMarkham Village is home to one of York Region's oldest schools. Opened as SS #17 in 1846 (later as SS #15), it became Markham Village Public School in 1886 and currently as Franklin Street Public School since early 1960s.\n\nTransportation\n\nPublic transit options are mostly limited by major arterial roads serving Markham Village:\n\n Highway 7 - York Region Transit Route 1 Highway 7 (East) and Viva Purple\n 16th Avenue - YRT Route 16 16th Avenue, 41 Markham Local, 301 Brother Andre C.H.S.\n Main Street - Toronto Transit Commission Route 102D Markham Rd. with limited stops along the route\n\nThere are two routes serving both Markham and Mount Joy GO Stations:\n YRT Route 201 Markham GO Shuttle - runs partially on 16th Avenue and Main Street with rest of route on side streets\n YRT Route 301 Markham Express - runs partially on 16th Avenue and Main Street with rest of route on side streets\n\nThree routes provides transit to students during school year with limited runs weekdays in the morning and afternoon:\n\n YRT Route 406 - routing on side streets in Markham Village \n YRT Route 410 - routing partially on 16th Avenue and rest on side streets within and beyond Markham Village \n YRT Route 411 Markham District H.S. - route on side streets to the east of Main Street and bypassing 16th Avenue and Highway 7\n\nMarkham GO Station is the only stop on the Stouffville line within Markham Village.

With over 700 volunteers working on more than 70 committees, Markham Fair is the largest community-based volunteer organization in Canada. The fair and fairgrounds are owned by the  Markham and East York Agricultural Society.\n\nThe fair occurs annually on the weekend before Canadian Thanksgiving, and hosts upwards of 80,000 attendees. Approximately 3,000 exhibitors enter more than 12,000 items, which are judged and put on display during the fair. Promoting excellence through competition in this way makes fairs unique in comparison to other events.\n\nAgricultural societies used to meet on a regular basis to discuss various concepts of agricultural improvement such as livestock development and increased grain yields. Often the society would collectively purchase a bull or seed grain, which would be made available to members only. The fall fair would then be an opportunity for the farmers to compete by showing off the fruits of their labour.\nDue to increased technology and rapid communication, agricultural societies no longer find it necessary to provide this service, but the Markham Fair continues to create the forum known as the fall fair, providing the community with a showcase for talents and products in a friendly competitive spirit.\n\nAs well as the competitive displays, the community is further brought together to enjoy various forms of entertainment such as horse pull, demolition derby, tractor pull, midway rides and displays of farm animals.\n\nFairgrounds\nThe fairgrounds are located in northern Markham at the northeast corner of McCowan Road and Elgin Mills Road and sits on  of former farm land (once farmed by Jonathan 'John' Williamson) and Stuart and Trevor Watson.\n\nThe site has several buildings used to house trade shows and other events. A 1/2-mile track and 4 wood stables are used to store animals. To the east of the fairgrounds is Little Rouge Creek.\n\nThe original fairground was located at the present day Markham Village Library at southeast corner of Markham Road and Highway 7 (farmland of Robert Goodfellow Armstrong and Wellington Hotel). The fair moved to the current site in 1977, as the original fairground area grew less agricultural. \n\nThe current library building was built to mimic the shape of the old Agricultural Hall that once stood at the site (along what is now Highway 7 on the south side from Washington Street to Jerman Street). A fire in 1916 burned down the new hall, ice rink and other buildings (barns). Only the rink was rebuilt (years later in 1963) on the site and currently part of the Markham Village Community Centre. The area where the track once sat are now homes with Reeves Park along Highway 48.\n\u02b1\n\nEvents\nMany shows and events are showcased throughout the duration of the fair. In previous years these shows have included:\n Agri-food Tent Shows (cooking shows)\n Gymnastics demonstration\n Freestyle Moto-Cross (FMX) Bike Demonstration\n Demolition Derby\n Tractor Pull\n Sheep Shearing Demonstration\n\nOther events\n\nA number of local events use the fairgrounds outside of the fair days including home shows, trade shows and warehouse sales.\n\nMidway\n\nWorld's Finest Shows runs the midway located at the West Gate of the fairgrounds.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest recorded fair held in Markham was in 1857 at the fairgrounds then located on the South East corner of the junction of Highways 7 (Wellington Street) and 48. Prior to that fairs was held in Unionville, Ontario in 1855. and also in Markham.\n\nIn 1865 Captain William Armstrong granted  of his land for the fairgrounds to build several buildings (grandstand, track, stalls, ice rink, exhibition hall) including a single floor agricultural hall. A new two floor hall, ticket office and rink was planned in 1894 and in 1916 a fire destroyed those buildings and were later replaced with a larger Agricultural Hall (Crystal Palace) to house the fair. The massive brick  by  rink would serve as an early recreation centre.\n\nIn 1963 the fair buildings were demolished to make way for the Markham Village Cenotaph and Community Centre (including indoor ice rink). In 1977 the Fair relocated to its current site where the four-day fair is held annually on the weekend preceding Canadian Thanksgiving. The Markham Village Library was built in 1980-1981 (on land bought by the then Town of Markham in 1975) now occupies the site of the old fairgrounds and mimics the barrel vault design of the old Agricultural Hall.\n\nBoard of directors\nThe society is an Ontario corporation that owns and operates the fair and its properties. It is governed by a board of 24 directors, who are elected at each annual meeting for a three-year period, and six junior directors (between the ages of 18-26) who are elected annually for a one-year period. All directors are elected by members of the society who attend the annual meeting. From among the directors, the President (Chair) and two vice-presidents are elected following the annual meeting, along with a Treasurer, General Manager, and Secretary.\n\nMission\nThe mission of the society is to encourage an awareness of agriculture and to promote improvements in the quality of life of persons living in an agricultural community by:\n researching and developing programs to meet the needs of the community;\n holding annual agricultural exhibitions featuring competitions for which prizes may be awarded;\n promoting the conservation of natural resources;\n encouraging the beautification of the community; and by\n supporting and providing facilities to encourage activities to enrich the community\n\nIn addition, there are over 750 volunteers involved with the operations, which fill the board seats and form some 75 committees, which share administrative duties and the Fair operating procedures.\n\nSee also\nOther Canadian annual fairs\n Canadian National Exhibition - Toronto\n Calgary Stampede - Calgary\n Edmonton K-Days - Edmonton\n Pacific National Exhibition - Vancouver\n Central Canada Exhibition - Ottawa\n Canadian Lakehead Exhibition - Thunder Bay\n Red River Exhibition - Winnipeg\n Royal Agricultural Winter Fair - Toronto\n Royal Manitoba Winter Fair - Brandon, Manitoba\n Schomberg Fair - Schomberg, Ontario\n Sooke Fall Fair - Sooke, British Columbia\n Streetsville Bread and Honey Festival - Mississauga\n Western Fair - London, Ontario\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nCategory:Annual fairs\nCategory:1844 establishments in Canada\nCategory:Fairs in Ontario\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Markham, Ontario\nCategory:Festivals established in 1844\n"}, {"id": "BkksMo3xK7FhyDfnrCIt", "content": "Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West\n\nProvincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West was an annual provincial agricultural fair held in various places in Canada West and after 1867 in Ontario.\n\nThe fair was established in 1846 and sponsored by the Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for Canada West. It replaced an earlier attempt in 1792 by the  Agricultural Society of Upper Canada founded in Newark in 1792.\n\nThe fair was mainly an agricultural themed show featuring horses and domesticated animals from around what was still a very rural pre-Confederation Ontario.
